There is no doubt that we notice them and appreciate them. They are decorative, they have meaning for us and they contribute to the visual texture of our surroundings.</p><p>Despite the fact that we value these items, it is not often that we examine these objects closely and observe their detail, or note any damage unless it is very obvious—a graffiti attack, for example.</p><p>Because these objects are designed to be outside and are made from durable materials, we think that they can withstand all sorts of conditions. They are durable but, like all materials, deteriorate. The process is constant.</p><p>Damage and deterioration can occur rapidly and be obvious. However, many items deteriorate slowly over long periods of time—and the damage is not seen clearly until it is advanced.

Figures, animals and other objects are combined to deliver jets, sprays and waterfalls. This includes drinking fountains for humans and animals.</p><p>‘Monument’ is usually in dedication to the memory of a person(s), founder(s), institution or government, which will usually be stipulated upon an accompanying plaque.</p><p>‘War Memorial’ is dedicated to involvement in any war, usually stipulated on a plaque as part of the memorial.</p><p>‘Mural’ is a decorative item. However, our interest lies with works executed by artists, rather than minor decorative embellishments. What one needs to look for is a signature or plaque commemorating the work of the artist(s).</p><p>‘Mosaic’ is a design made by cementing small pieces of hard, coloured materials (eg. marble, glass, ceramic or semi-precious stones) to a base.</p><p>‘Terrazzo floor’ is a mixture of marble chips and cement used for flooring. It is laid in situ, ground smooth and then polished.</p><p>‘Artefact’ is an item which is related to historical events, and may include items such as a cannon, anchor or horse trough.</p></div><div class="column"><p>The following items will not be included in the AICCM’s current project: plaque, gate, fence, step, an architectural feature—part of a building, rock art, outdoor site, engineering structure, mining equipment, agricultural machinery, garden, ‘big’ thing—advertising material, street furniture, playground equipment and cemeteries. These items are not priorities for this survey. However, you may decide to use this form for your own record- keeping about these items.</p><p>1.4 Overall Description Briefly describe the work including its subject/theme. For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR—proper right—and PL— proper left—to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue, that is your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue. For abstract works, describe the predominant forms, colours, shapes and textures. For descriptions of either abstract or figurative pieces, avoid judgemental language.</p><p>1.5 Overall Condition What is the overall general appearance or condition of the work? Please indicate any broken or missing parts and describe evidence of cracks. Are there obvious signs of deterioration which require urgent treatment, or is it well maintained?</p><p>1.6 Primary Artist(s) Is(are) the person(s) responsible for the overall conception and creation of the work. Frequently the artist’s name will appear toward the back, lower edge or another inconspicuous place on the sculpture, followed by the abbreviations ‘Sc’, ‘Sculp’ for sculptor/sculpted.</p><p>1.7 Foundry/Fabricator If the piece was cast, the foundry name or monogram symbol, as well as cast date, may appear on the base of the sculpture or another inconspicuous place.</p><p>‘Base’ is the support on which the object is placed. Some works will include a plinth as well as a base; however, for the purpose of this survey they should be described jointly.</p><div class="page" title="Page 125"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.10 MEDIA</strong></span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Metal</strong></span></p><p>1.

The size of the work can be an important factor here. The Archibald Fountain in Hyde Park, Sydney is very much a focus of space, whereas a small bust on a low pedestal between shrubs in a garden is unlikely to be a focus. But size alone is not the determining factor.

									       <div class="page" title="Page 127"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Maintenance</strong></span></p><p>Regular maintenance is important if an item and its surroundings are kept clean and tidy and appear cared for, the item is less likely to be vandalised.</p><p>This also helps to raise public interest in the piece, which means that any vandalism that does take place is more likely to be reported and can be dealt with swiftly.</p><p>If maintenance is done regularly, you are more likely to notice problems as they occur, and can deal with damage earlier.</p><p>Maintenance includes:</p><ul><li><p>washing surfaces regularly with water and sponges. This prevents a build-up of dirt on the surface, which not only looks unattractive but can lead to staining, particularly in the case of porous stone items. Make sure that water is not left pooling on the object; dry it with rags if necessary;</p></li><li><p>removal of bird droppings—the sooner the better. Bird droppings become acidic over time and can etch into surfaces. The longer they are left, the more damage they can cause. Bird droppings can remove patinas on metal objects; and</p></li><li><p>clearing drainage outlets and weep holes. Many sculptures are designed with water outlets, to prevent water building up in unwanted areas. These holes are generally quite small, and easily clog up with leaves and debris. Clearing them regularly helps to ensure the longevity of the object.</p></li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ground barrier</strong></span></p><p>Display items with wheels—like carts—in such a way that the wheels are lifted up off the ground. This alleviates stress on the small areas of the wheels which are touching the ground, and prevents contact between the wheel and the ground.</p></div><div class="column"><p>This is important, because every time it rains the ground becomes wet and acts like a sponge around the wheel, creating conditions that will contribute to corrosion if the wheel is metal, and to rot and insect attack if the wheel is made of wood.</p><p>There should always be a barrier between a sculpture and the ground, unless the artist specifically wants the work directly in contact with the ground.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Grass and plants</strong></span></p><p>If contact between an outdoor object and the ground is considered necessary, it is important to keep grass trimmed around the piece, because long grass will also hold moisture close to the surface of the object.</p><p>When you are mowing around outdoor heritage items, take care that small stones and sticks are not thrown up, because they can damage the item’s surface. This is especially important with painted metal items, where a break in the paint layer can cause corrosion problems.</p><p>It is best not to whipper snipper close to outdoor heritage items because the whipper snipper action can cause damage.</p><p>Consider the positioning of plants around outdoor objects. Remember that overgrown bushes make it difficult to see the objects clearly. Plants can also cause damage, for example, by scratching the surface; by branches dropping onto the object; a faster build-up of leaves in drainage holes; damage to foundations from root growth; and by attracting insects which will attack the object.</p><p>Naturally, it is important to consider the heritage value of the planting as well. It is also important to note that well positioned planting can act as a windbreak on sites where dust and pollutants are problems for the objects.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Water</strong></span></p><p>Look for areas where rain can become trapped and held against a surface. Where possible, alter the display technique to prevent this happening. If you are unable to make any alterations, it is important to set up a program of regular monitoring, so that you can identify damage early on and act to treat it.</p></div></div></div></div>       								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									  <div class="page" title="Page 128"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Avoid watering the object when you are watering surrounding gardens. The garden may need water to survive, but outdoor objects do better without additional water.</p><p>Sprinklers often spread water horizontally, so that the water can enter areas of the sculpture protected from normal rainfall.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Coatings</strong></span></p><p>Microcrystalline wax is often applied to bronze sculptures to protect them from damage—from both the environment and graffiti. Like all coating systems, it offers protection only if it is complete.</p><p>A coating system which has broken down can be more damaging to a sculpture than no coating system at all. So it is important to monitor the condition of the coating and renew it annually.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on the care of bronze items and the application of coatings to bronze items,please see the chapter on <a href="">Metals</a> in this volume.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Graffiti</strong></span></p><p>Graffiti can be a major problem. If the object has an anti-graffiti coating, then it is this coating which is damaged, not the object. If an appropriate system is used, it is far easier to remove a coating system than graffiti.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Beware of coating systems which seal off stone surfaces, this can lead to spalling of the stone, as moisture trapped under the coating cannot escape and may build up pressure.</span><br><span style="color: #000000;"> If a graffiti coating is to be applied to the surface of a heritage item, it is recommended that a conservator is consulted for advice.</span></p><p>If graffiti needs to be removed from the surface of a heritage item, it is best to contact a conservator for advice before taking any action. The successful removal of graffiti is very much dependent upon the media used to apply the graffiti and the nature of the object which has been graffitied.</p></div><div class="column"><p>When consulting a conservator about graffiti removal, try to be specific about the amount of graffiti and what it looks like. Systems used to remove graffiti can be quite specific and the conservator needs specific information; this is particularly important if a range of graffiti media has been used, for example, spray can, pen or crayon.</p><p>It is best to remove graffiti as soon as possible. Graffiti invites more graffiti, and it is far easier to remove when it is fresh than when it has had several months to set.</p><p>If you are using solvents to remove graffiti from stone, you run the risk of driving the stain further into the object rather than drawing it out, as stone is extremely porous. It is best to use a poultice system such as Safest Stripper by 3M or Quick Strip when removing graffiti from stone.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are using Quick Strip remember that even if the system used removes the graffiti, it may alter the colour of the underlying stone so that the ghost of the graffiti is still present. Do not paint over graffiti on a cultural heritage item.</span></p><p>Consult a conservator if you are considering using an air-abrasive cleaning system, such as sand- blasting to remove graffiti. Abrasive cleaning removes graffiti, but often removes a layer from the surface of the object as well.</p><div class="page" title="Page 129"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>this visual history will be lost. In some cases this may be valid, for example, if the deterioration is threatening the existence of the object. However, in most cases it will be a matter of:</p><ul><li><p>consulting with the relevant people, that is, conservators, custodians, historians and the artist;</p></li><li><p>weighing up a number of factors, such as the artist’s intention, the relationship between the item and its site, and the historic or cultural significance of the piece; and</p></li><li><p>taking into account the ethics of the conservation treatment.</p></li></ul><p>These general guidelines are provided to help you if you have a damaged piece of outdoor cultural material.</p><p>If part of an item has broken off, collect all the pieces, wrap each piece separately and place the pieces in a clearly labelled box. Contact a conservator as soon as possible. Because the other half of the break is in an outdoor setting, it is best that the repair is done as soon as possible before the edges are worn by weathering, or before more damage occurs.</p><p>Do not repair stone with concrete. These repairs are usually unattractive; but they can also be damaging because the concrete can be harder than the stone. If this is the case, future cracks form in the stone, not in the concrete.</p><p>Heritage items should not be repainted. The original paintwork is an integral part of these items and can be damaged and destroyed by repainting. Consult a conservator if you feel that repainting is important for the future survival of any painted items.</p><p>Beware of replacing components of a heritage item to ‘pretty it up’. It is often tempting to replace worn or damaged components, especially where the skills and technology are readily available; but you must be aware that it may interfere with the historic value of the item. Remember, an historic artefact is only as historic as the sum of its components. Consult a conservator if you are unsure about whether to replace components.</p><p>Avoid using sand-blasting and steam-cleaning to treat historic artefacts. While there are occasions when an air-abrasive technique will be necessary</p></div><div class="column"><p>to treat an item, sand-blasting is generally considered to be too abrasive. It causes loss of surface detail and pitting of the surface, which in metal objects can lead to accelerated corrosion. Steam-cleaning is often used on stone and it is also too harsh. It can cause loss of detail on delicate, stone surfaces.</p><p>If you need to use metal fixtures with metal outdoor objects, wherever possible use fixtures of the same metal as the structure to be secured. In this way you can avoid the problems of galvanic corrosion. If you cannot use the same metal, place an inert barrier layer between the two different metals.</p><p>Some outdoor sculpture is intended to deteriorate. Unless there is a public safety issue involved, these objects should be left alone to deteriorate slowly. Any work that must be done on the piece should always be carried out in consultation with the artist, if the artist is alive and accessible.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>  								</div>
