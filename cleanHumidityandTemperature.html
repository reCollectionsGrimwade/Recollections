However, there can be some conflict between the needs of people and the requirements for the care of collections.</p><p>Relative humidity—RH—is the amount of water vapour contained in the air at a particular temperature compared with the total amount of water vapour the air can contain at that temperature. Relative humidity is expressed as a percentage. Various materials respond differently over a range of humidity levels and there is an optimum level of RH suitable for the display and storage of mixed materials.</p><p>Extremes of relative humidity and temperature can adversely affect the condition of objects, particularly those made of organic materials. But it is important to remember that many materials will stabilise in a particular climate, even though conditions are extreme. Once stabilised and conditioned to the climate, these materials will not necessarily be adversely affected by the constant, extreme conditions.</p><p>If the climate changes or objects are moved to a different climate, problems can arise. Changes in relative humidity and temperature—particularly rapid changes—are potentially far more damaging to most materials than are constant extremes. These changes can occur easily with sudden changes in the local weather, when air- conditioning units break down, and when objects are moved from storage boxes to open display or from one region of the country to another.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Steps can be taken to minimise fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature, and to protect valuable collections from the adverse effects of extremes of relative humidity and temperature. To do this, it is useful to understand how relative humidity and temperature are related, what causes relative humidity to fluctuate, and to know what effects they have on different types of materials.</p></div></div></div>        								</div>

The capacity of air to hold water- vapour varies according to the air temperature.</p><p>However, although raising the temperature increases the capacity of air to hold water, there is not always water available to move into the air to fill that increased capacity. So changes in temperature often lead to quite significant alterations to the relative humidity.</p><p>For example, in an empty, sealed box containing a fixed amount of water-vapour, raising the temperature will lower the relative humidity. This is because the capacity of the air to contain water has increased but the actual amount of water has remained the same. Using our previous example of air at 20oC with 8.5g/m3 of water-vapour, if the temperature is raised to 30oC and no additional water is available:</p></div><div class="page" style="text-align: center;" title="Page 24"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1100" src="./Humidity and Temperature _ reCollections_files/42a-humidity-equation-rcoll.jpg" alt="42a---humidity-equation---rcoll" width="400" height="90"><br><div class="page" title="Page 24"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><div class="page" title="Page 24"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">The reverse is also true.

The risks of physical damage, such as warping, cracking and splitting, chemical deterioration, and insect or mould attack are all increased when temperature and relative humidity are too high or too low.</p><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The effects of extremes and fluctuations in temperature</strong></span></p><p>Extremes and fluctuations in temperature are potentially less harmful than extremes or fluctuations in relative humidity; but it is difficult to separate the two because they are closely interrelated. Some independent effects of high temperature include:</p><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li>increased biological activity. Most insects and moulds thrive and reproduce readily in warmer conditions; and</li><li>acceleration of chemical deterioration processes. Temperature affects the rate at which chemical reactions take place. For example, a temperature rise from 20–30oC may double the rate of some degradation reactions. And this worsens if light, water or pollution also contribute to these chemical reactions.</li></ul><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about how light and pollutants can affect chemical deterioration, please see the chapters on <a href="">Light &amp; UV Radiation</a> and on <a href="">Dust and Pollutants</a> in this volume.</span></p><p>Fluctuations in temperature cause:</p><ul><li><p>expansion and contraction. If this is uneven and/or rapid, it can cause physical damage and distortion. This can be hazardous for objects made of composite materials; and</p></li><li><p>some types of plastic, for example, vinyl records, shrink and warp in high temperatures.</p></li></ul><p>The most important effect of temperature is the effect it has on altering relative humidity levels.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The effects of extremes and fluctuations in relative humidity</strong></span></p><p>In high relative humidity conditions insects and moulds thrive and reproduce readily, metals corrode, dyes and textiles fade and deteriorate more quickly, organic materials such as wood and leather swell or change shape, and gelatine emulsions and adhesives become sticky.</p><div class="page" title="Page 26"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Organic materials absorb water. This is particularly noticeable in thinner materials, such as paper, vellum and parchment, textiles, leather and bark paintings. As materials absorb water, they swell and change shape, for example, stretched vellums and mounted textiles sag.</p><p>The effects of humidity on organic materials are not always immediately noticeable. But after a while, extensive damage eventually occurs.</p><p>For example, a large block of wood may take weeks or even months to transfer water from its surface into its bulk, leading to different parts of the wood having different water-contents. The consequence this has on the wood is to make it swell by different amounts, which will have the effect of splitting and warping the material.</p><p>Wood also swells more across the grain than along the grain; and by an amount which varies according to the type of wood. This makes life complicated when caring for furniture.</p><p>Textiles can display what seems to be the opposite response to changes in relative humidity. A multi- strand thread shortens in length when the relative humidity goes up. This is because the individual threads expand in diameter more than they expand in length. The result is that the strands wrap around each other more tightly, which causes the overall length to decrease. Often this process does not reverse when the relative humidity drops again.</p><p>A canvas responds in the same way as textiles; however, the paint layer on the canvas does not contract. Rather, it will compress, leading to cracking or separation between canvas and paint layer.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Different components of single objects absorb moisture at different rates and swell by different amounts. This can cause problems, such as paint layers splitting and separating from timber panels.</p><p>Composites of metal and wood are affected also. As the metal corrodes, the wood starts to split in order to accommodate the corrosion products.</p><p>Adhesives that absorb water become sticky and are an attractive food source for moulds and insects.</p><p>Gelatine emulsions on photographs also swell in humid conditions and can readily stick to the glass in their frames or, if they are stacked, they can stick together.</p><p>As for papers which are stuck down at the edges, they will increase in size in humid conditions and thus expand in the middle as their edges are restricted. This can lead to creasing.</p><p>In very low relative humidity conditions, such as in arid areas:</p><ul><li>insects can still survive;</li><li>organic materials give out the moisture they contain. This can cause materials to dry out and become brittle or to distort and split;</li><li>thicker materials lose moisture much more rapidly from their surface. This can cause warping;</li><li>different components of single objects release moisture at different rates, which can cause the bonds between them to loosen; and</li><li>adhesives dry out and crack, and can fail as a result.</li></ul><p>If fluctuations are occurring constantly, the materials are being subjected to constant movement which is usually not uniform and often results in cracking, splitting and warping. Some examples of extreme damage caused by fluctuations are:</p><ul><li>bark paintings expand and contract as they absorb water and release it. This leads to the bark warping and splitting, and they can lose paint;</li><li>bone and ivory are very susceptible to damage caused by fluctuations; and they warp and split. This is especially a problem for very thin ivory sheets, such as those used for miniature painting;</li><li>furniture with veneers can be damaged severely, because the thin, veneer layer is likely to curl and pop off the surface of the furniture if it repeatedly expands and contracts; and</li><li>fluctuations in relative humidity can also alter the chemical composition of some minerals, so that they become another mineral.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What happens in extreme, but stable environments?</strong></span></p><p>When conditions are extreme but constant, damage can still occur. Experience shows, however, that many materials become conditioned to an extreme environment.</p><p>An object in constantly high or low relative humidity does not absorb and lose water repeatedly; and it is not subject to the enormous stresses of the cycles which affect objects in fluctuating environments. Such an object is likely to be preserved longer and in better condition than a similar object in a fluctuating environment.</p><p>Remember, the emphasis should be on stability.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>        								</div>

Regional climates are particularly significant for objects which are displayed outside.</p><p>Because buildings are not fully sealed, outside conditions have a significant influence on the climate inside the building. The building’s style, the materials used, the state of repair of the building and whether the building is insulated, air- conditioned or without either, all influence the impact outside conditions have on the climate inside the building.</p><p>Although buildings are not fully sealed from the outside weather, they act as barriers to the free flow of heat and moisture. This is why air- conditioning and heating are effective in providing a comfortable climate.</p><p>Within buildings there are localised climates and microclimates where conditions vary greatly from conditions in other parts of the building. For example, there would be greater variations in temperature and humidity in a small tea room with a toaster and a kettle than there would be in a closed-off storage area.</p><p>Cupboards, display cases, boxes and frames act as barriers to air and moisture circulation and can develop their own microclimate.

This type of airconditioner should be used with caution, and preferably with a humidifier to add moisture to the air. Monitoring the effectiveness of such equipment is crucial.</p><p>If you have airconditioning or you are considering installing it, you should be aware of the following important points:</p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li>the cost of purchasing, operating and maintaining an airconditioning plant is high.

A well- maintained building of solid construction provides a very reasonable environment for collections.</p><p>A building made of thick stone walls or cavity- brick construction with high ceilings provides good insulation against climatic changes. In hot weather, these buildings take a few days to heat up; and then, as the outside temperature drops, they lose heat slowly. Fluctuations occur, but they occur gradually.</p><p>Make sure your building is well-maintained, so that it provides the maximum possible seal against fluctuations in the outside environment. This is particularly important if the building is made of light building materials and is in a fairly extreme environment.</p><p>Clean out gutters, repair cracks in walls and ceilings, and have leaky roofs checked. This improves the stability of the temperature and humidity inside.</p><p>If you are considering upgrading the buildings, remember to insulate walls and ceilings— especially if the building is constructed from light-weight or heat-conductive materials such as fibro and corrugated iron. By so doing, it can not only help to modify the internal environment, but also ensure better preservation of the collection as well as making people feel more comfortable inside.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use the features of the building</strong></span></p><p>Improved conditions for the storage and display of collections can be achieved by choosing good storage and display sites within the building, and using the features of the building to modify conditions.</p><p>The most stable area of a non-airconditioned building is an internal room on the ground floor— because it is buffered against climatic changes.</p><p>There are other areas one could choose. Basements are acceptable as they provide a cool temperature. However, they are likely to be damp.

It is no use shutting doors and windows to keep mould spores out because they are everywhere anyway. Dehumidifiers should be used only as a remedial measure to adjust a dangerously wet environment. In warm, humid conditions, you should avoid sealing objects in plastic, because it will not allow them to breathe, creating a risk of mould growth.</p><div class="page" title="Page 39"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 9</strong></span></p><p>Answer: a) and b). You could install airconditioning; but it’s not completely necessary if you are able to create suitable microclimates.
