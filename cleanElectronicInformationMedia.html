									     <div class="page" title="Page 130"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Increasingly, museums, galleries and libraries are using electronic media to improve access to their collections, to enhance their documentary collections, as publishing options and as exhibits. As the interest in, and use of, electronic media increases, people are becoming more concerned about preserving these formats.</p><p>The main carriers, or media, for electronic information are hard disks, floppy disks, audio tapes, video tapes and CD-ROMs. Preserving electronic information and media is about being able to use them for as long as you want to. However, preserving electronic media is not straightforward. There are two main issues to consider:</p><ul><li>the preservation of the actual item, that is, the CD-ROM or the audio tape; and</li></ul><ul><li>preserving the information.</li></ul><p>When it comes to preserving electronic information and media, conservators tend to believe that preserving the information is more important than preserving the media. There are many reasons for this. One of the main ones is the recognition that technology is advancing at such a rate that many of the media used today may be obsolete in the near future. Think about how quickly compact discs— CDs—replaced the once familiar vinyl LP record.</p><p>Obviously, if you have invested in a certain technology you will want to protect your investment and be able to use your electronic media for as long as possible. This will require that the carrier and the machine needed to access the information are in good condition. This section gives basic information on caring for electronic media—with an emphasis on video and audio recordings.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Electronic information is inherently short-lived and at some stage the information will need to be transferred from its present carrier to a new carrier, before the present medium deteriorates or your equipment stops working. This may be in a few years or a decade, but you must plan for this transfer to take place.</p><p>In the meantime, this section will help you to care for your electronic media. If you are particularly interested in preserving electronic media, it is strongly recommended that you keep in touch with the latest developments—the library network can help you with this.</p></div></div></div></div>     								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									     <div class="page" title="Page 131"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The basic principles of magnetic recording were first discovered in the 1890s. Not much was done with the discovery because the necessary electronics hadn’t been invented.</p><p>Audio recordings on tape were invented in the early 1930s and introduced to the domestic market in the late 1940s.</p><p>Several companies tried to develop a videotape recorder in the early 1950s, but Ampex was the first to succeed in April 1956.</p><p>The first on-air broadcast of videotaped material occurred on 30 November 1956, with the CBS Douglas Edwards evening news broadcast.</p><p>In 1968, Sony introduced the first videotape recorder that was small enough and cheap enough for use in education. It was replaced by the Sony U-Matic cassette recorder in 1971 which was still in use 25 years later.</p><p>The videotape recorder was not cheap enough for the consumer until Sony introduced the BetaMax in 1975. In 1976, JVC introduced the VHS VCR, and the battle of the formats began. In 1989, Sony introduced the Hi8 camcorder.</p><p>Digital videotape recording started in 1987 when the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers established the D1 standard. Digital has a major advantage over the previous analogue- based recorders, because there is no degradation when tapes are copied.</p><p>Since the introduction of the D1 format, at least four others have been launched. None of them dominates the market and D1 itself is now virtually obsolete.</p></div></div></div></div>     								</div>

									     <div class="page" title="Page 131"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>All magnetic tape media consist of three components:</p><p>• ferromagnetic recording material, capable of being magnetised when placed in a magnetic field;</p></div><div class="column"><ul><li><p>substrate or base material, on which the recording material is coated; and</p></li><li><p>a binder which functions as a carrier for the recording material, and bonds it to the substrate.</p></li></ul><p>The magnetic materials used in audio recordings and video recordings are properly described as ferromagnetic. They are characterised by strong, easily detectable, spontaneous and permanent magnetisation—even without an external magnetic field.</p><p>Audio information, for example, speech or music, is recorded in the magnetic layer as a continuously varying analogue sound signal. The magnetic<br> signal is made by an electromagnet, which conveys variations in electrical strength from the output of a microphone to the recording medium. On playback, the original sound is reproduced by reversing the process and replacing the microphone with a loudspeaker.</p><p>Video information, for example, the moving images filmed at weddings or on holidays, is recorded in the magnetic layer as a continuously varying analogue signal. Sound information on videos is recorded in the same way, but only in narrow tracks along the edges of videos.</p><p>The magnetic signal is made by a magnetic field. It can be erased deliberately when a new recording is made. But it can also be altered accidentally by a magnetic field that gets close enough to the recorded signal to alter it.</p><p>If magnetised material gets hot enough, the magnetism disappears. The point at which this occurs varies with the recording material. For example, with iron alloys it is 770oC.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recording materials</strong></span></p><p>The International Electrotechnical Commission— IEM—classify audio tapes into three types: Types I, II and III. A tape’s classification is determined by the recording material used.</p><p>The gamma form of ferric oxide, iron rust, is the most widely used recording material. It is the recording material for audio cassettes designated as Type I. They are typically described as normal bias tapes.</p><div class="page" title="Page 132"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Chromium dioxide was introduced in the late 1960s as a magnetic material suitable for high-density recording. These are known as IEC Type II—high bias—audio cassettes.</p><p>Pure iron particles, the recording material used by so-called metal media, are used in IEC Type III audio cassettes and digital audio tape—DAT— cassettes. They support recording densities approximately three times stronger than gamma ferric oxide particles.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Substrates</strong></span></p><p>With magnetic tapes, the substrate is typically plastic film.</p><p>The base materials of early magnetic tapes, some of which may be stored in libraries and archives, were composed of cellulose triacetate or polyvinyl chloride—PVC.</p><p>Substrates of newer magnetic tape invariably consist of polyethylene teraphthalate—PET—which is often identified by one of its trade names, such as Du Pont’s Mylar or Eastman Kodak’s Estar and is known in the film industry as polyester. Compared with earlier substrate materials, PET films are stronger and more resistant to high temperatures and humidity.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Binders</strong></span></p><p>Early magnetic tapes featured polyvinyl chloride— PVC—binders. Today, polyethylene binders are commonly used. These binders don’t stand up well to high humidity which softens the binder. If the binder has softened to the extent that the particles either move or come right off the base, permanent damage will have been done to the recording. In a dry environment, it is possible that the binder may be re-hardened by reverse hydrolysis to get the sound back.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>     								</div>

Major brand-name tapes from audio and VCR equipment manufacturers or magnetic products manufacturers are generally of a consistently good quality.</p><p>For important recordings, make two copies on tapes drawn from different manufacturing batches.</p><p>Comply fully with specifications established by the manufacturer on which the media will be recorded or played.</p></div><div class="column"><p>If you are in the north of Australia in summer or the south of Australia in winter, allow time—about one hour—for your video camera and video tapes to warm up or cool down before use. A rapid change from an air-conditioned room to tropical heat and humidity in the northern summer, or from a heated room to the cold and damp of a southern winter environment, can clog video heads and jam video cassettes.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Looking after the magnetic signal</strong></span></p><p>Magnetic recordings on tape are made and destroyed by strong magnetic fields—such as the permanent magnets in headphones and loudspeakers.

Copying is known as dubbing.</p><p>Before copying, carefully rewind two or three times any tape which has not been used for several years. Careful rewinding relieves any tension in the tape, and reduces the effect of print-through.</p><p>Consider using electronic filtering when older recordings are being dubbed onto a new copy. Filtering can sometimes be effective in removing unwanted noise and the effects of wear or damage. Clearly label the original recordings and the copies.</p><p>Throw out all damaged tapes after copying them. A damaged tape can damage your equipment and this can damage the rest of your tapes.</p><div class="page" title="Page 134"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storing and maintaining tapes so they will last</strong></span></p><p>Heat and high humidity are the two greatest enemies of audio and video tapes in storage.</p><p>Ideally, store video tapes in an environment where temperature is constant and in the range 18-24°C and where relative humidity is constant and in the range 35-45%.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about the steps you can take to control relative humidity and temperature, please see <a href="./cleanHumidityandTemperature.html">Humidity and Temprature</a>.</span></p><p>Achieving these conditions can be difficult, but the following steps will protect your tapes, even when the conditions are not ideal.</p><p>Store tapes in an environment that is slightly cooler and drier than is comfortable for humans, in a clean atmosphere and in polythene bags.</p><p>Fast-forward and rewind the tapes before storage— make sure that the tapes are correctly wound inside the cassette.</p><p>Protect tapes from rapid fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.</p><p>Keep tapes out of direct sunlight and away from local heat sources.</p><p>Shelve tapes upright in sturdy shelves with dividing supports every 100mm-150mm.
