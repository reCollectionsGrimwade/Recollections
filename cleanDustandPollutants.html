								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									 <div class="page" title="Page 59"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Solid particles that are suspended in air are usually referred to as particulate matter or aerosols.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Materials that settle on surfaces in still air are usually referred to as dust or grit.</p><p>The size of the particles is measured in microns— μm. One micron is one-thousandth of a millimetre. Smaller particles remain suspended in the air until they are trapped on a surface. Materials which are porous or have heavily textured or sticky surfaces are particularly likely to attract these very fine particles. Larger particles tend to settle near their source.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Where does particulate matter come from?</strong></span></p><p>Particulate matter from the outside environment comes from a variety of sources: burning fuel, motor vehicle exhaust, furnaces, metal from tram tracks, dust from building sites, chlorides from salt spray or dust and dirt from the natural environment.</p><p>Particulate matter can also be generated within a building. In new buildings, concrete and cement can give off very fine dust particles for up to two years after initial pouring. These particles are extremely alkaline and will damage objects they settle on, for example, they will discolour linseed oil, some dyes and pigments and attack alkaline-sensitive material such as silks and photographs.</p><p>In existing buildings, air-conditioning systems which are not cleaned regularly or do not have appropriate filters, as well as gas and oil heaters, kitchens and workrooms, have the potential to produce particulate pollution which can affect objects.</p><p>A lot of dust is made up of human skin and hair. These materials are very attractive to insects.</p><p>Chemically active particulate material can also be introduced as part of some pest control treatments. For example, certain large chemical dust particles placed on surfaces such as<br> shelves can poison pests as they crawl over these areas. However, this type of pest control treatment is not advised where cultural materials may be present.</p><p>Particulate matter may also contain other adsorbed or absorbed material such as acids from atmospheric sulphur dioxide, or traces of metal from industrial processes.</p><div class="page" title="Page 60"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Problems with particulate matter</strong></span></p><p>Dust can build up to quite a large mass in areas that are not easily accessible, or which may easily trap airborne dust particles. Dust absorbs moisture readily, so that areas with a large build-up of dust can have quite high local humidity even when the environment surrounding the object is completely stable at 50%RH.</p><p>In recessed areas, such as between the lower stretcher bar and the canvas of a painting or<br> in the interstices of basketwork, the build-up of dust creates problems for paint layers. This can lead to cracking and other physical damage as the dust creates physical distortion of the structural components of the object.</p><p>Dust on objects will absorb and adsorb pollutants. In conjunction with moisture, absorption of pollutants can lead to severe damage. For example, dust particles which contain chlorides can cause bronze disease on bronze objects.</p><p>Dust also attracts and harbours pests—enabling insects to hide and nest in secure environments.</p><p>Gritty dust causes physical damage, particularly if you clean the dust away by rubbing. It could lead to abrasion and scratching.</p><p>Sticky dust, for example, soot, will stain most surfaces. Dirt can be absorbed into extremely porous or intricate surfaces such as paper, basketwork and plaster casts which, once dirty, may be impossible to clean.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Carbonaceous material</strong></span></p><p>Carbonaceous particulate matter is produced from several sources including cigarette smoke, car fumes, furnaces and industrial workplaces which burn material. It is often extremely sticky and tarry.</p><p>If a surface is not porous, carbonaceous particles are quite easy to remove when they first settle. However, if left on an object, their acidity will cause them to etch into the surface. Airborne carbonaceous material is also likely to contain sulphur compounds.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chlorides</strong></span></p><p>Salt air is a particular problem. While marine environments are the most likely source of salt,</p></div><div class="column"><p>there are other sources of chloride contamination of cultural material. These include chlorinated water and areas with high saline concentrations— such as occur in some inland areas of Australia— and sweaty fingers.</p><p>Chlorides are gritty and will abrade surfaces, but they can also produce chemical reactions. An example of this is the reaction in copper which produces copper chlorides—a highly corrosive substance capable of causing considerable damage to cultural material. This type of damage to copper and bronze objects is commonly known as bronze disease.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on chlorides and bronze disease, please see the chapter on <a href="./cleanMetals.html">Metals</a> in Cultural Material.</span></p><div class="page" title="Page 66"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aerosols</strong></span></p><p>The term aerosol is used in a number of different ways in the literature. Osborn (1989) provides a good definition. He defines aerosols as ‘very small particles which are less than 1 micron and which act as a nucleus for the condensation of liquid’.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Smaller particles which tend to be trapped</strong></span></p><p>Generally, smaller particles—from .01 microns to 15-20 microns—remain suspended in the air until they are trapped. They can be trapped by adhesion to sticky surfaces such as waxes; porous surfaces such as paper; textured surfaces such as feathers; or by a physical barrier. Being small, they are usually light and are extremely mobile.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Larger particles which tend to settle</strong></span></p><p>Larger particles—particles greater than 15-20 microns—tend to settle near their source. This means that near the source there is likely to be a heavy deposit of these large particles. This kind of particulate matter is easier to collect than the smaller particles, but it will cause more damage because of its mass.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Concrete buildings</strong></span></p><p>Studies have indicated that concrete dust can be given off for up to two years after the completion of the building. The only studies on this have been done by Toishi (Thompson, 1986). However, this phenomenon has been seen in buildings in Australia, and is easily checked in buildings—by placing a clean blotter on a shelf in a suspect area. If concrete dust is a problem, you will see dust settling on the paper.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>

								<h4 class="dslc-tabs-nav-hook">       Protection from dust       </h4>
								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									 <div class="page" title="Page 59"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea">&nbsp;Protecting your collection from the harmful effects of dust is a combination of common sense and expertise. Good building design to keep dust out— together with good housekeeping practices to stop its distribution through to display and storage areas—will radically reduce damage from particulate matter.<div class="page" title="Page 60"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It is worth developing a strategic plan to identify and deal with problems. The best place to start is to look at the building and its ability to keep out dust. In salty, dusty or dirty environments:</p><ul><li><p>use air-sealing strips around doors, windows and filter air vents;</p></li><li><p>provide doormats for visitors;</p></li><li><p>double doors will provide some protection against dust entering the building;</p></li><li><p>keep windows closed if possible. This is not always advisable in a tropical climate, because good ventilation is vital to reduce the risk of mould growth; and</p></li><li><p>place any objects which are particularly susceptible to abrasion—or are hard to clean—in dust jackets or boxes during storage, and in display cases for exhibition.</p></li></ul><p>Even well-protected buildings can have large amounts of particulates in the atmosphere. New concrete should be sealed. But remember to check</p><div class="page" title="Page 61"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>that the sealant is safe for use in areas which contain cultural objects, and make sure that there are no objects nearby when it is applied. It is important also to allow enough time for the sealant to dry and offgas before housing the objects in the area. Don’t underestimate the time it takes a material to offgas. Plastic paints need to be aired for three to six weeks to allow for the acetic acid to dissipate fully.</p><p>Workshop areas and kitchens are known producers of particulate matter. If possible, these areas should be sealed well and sited away from storage and exhibition areas. Use good housekeeping practices in these areas—try to vacuum regularly.</p><p>Remember that air-conditioning systems will circulate harmful material from one outlet to another, so check that your ducting system is not pumping workroom dust or tearoom grease onto your objects. If possible, design your air- conditioning ducting so that dust-producing areas are at the end of the system.</p><p>Protect particularly susceptible surfaces. Plaster casts and natural history specimens should be housed in cases or provided with dust jackets. Works of art on paper should be stored in Solander boxes or sealed in frames. Objects with intricate surfaces, such as basketry or textiles, should be boxed for storage or displayed in display cases. And avoid spraying aerosols near objects. These usually contain hydrocarbons and other harmful pollutants. Hydrocarbons react in the presence of air, and become brown and sticky over time, causing irreversible staining.</p><p>Many materials are either electrostatic or sticky enough to attract dust. Perspex, Mylar and plastics are good examples of this. Some coatings which are recommended in conservation literature may also be sticky, for example waxes and dressings, or will build up an electrostatic charge, for example, synthetic resins. Seek the advice of a trained conservator before using coatings and resins on cultural objects.</p><p>Cases, boxes, slip covers and folders can all be used to protect objects from particulate matter. Cases can be fitted with dust filters; and silicon sealant can be used in loose-fitting cases. Slip covers can be made out of undyed, natural fabrics such as calico.</p><p>If you have an air-conditioning system, it needs to be kept in good condition, and filters checked and changed as necessary. An air-conditioning system which is not maintained properly can cause more damage to a collection than no air-conditioning at all.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>

In Australia, Melbourne and Sydney are well known for their polluted environments; but even in small country towns air pollution can be a problem.</p><p>Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and ozone are all pollutant gases. Of these, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone cause the most damage. Sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide are called acidic gases because they react with water to produce acids.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid</strong></span></p><p>Sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide are harmful substances produced from pollutants in the air. These substances are formed when sulphur reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce sulphur dioxide, and ultimately sulphuric acid while in the presence of water.</p><p>Polluting sulphur in the environment reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide:</p><p style="text-align: center;">S+02 =S02</p><p>The sulphur dioxide further reacts with oxygen:</p><p style="text-align: center;">2SO2 + O2 = 2SO3</p><p>and in the presence of water sulphuric acid is formed:</p><p style="text-align: center;">SO3 + H2O = H2SO4</p><p>Sulphuric acid is highly corrosive. It attacks outdoor sculpture and damages buildings as these contain calcium carbonate—a material present in limestone, marble and sandstone.</p><div class="page" title="Page 62"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>All three sulphur compounds—sulphur, sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid—also have an affect on certain metals. For example, sulphur dioxide rusts iron. Whereas sulphur on its own can cause silver to tarnish. As for lead, this metal deteriorates rapidly in the presence of sulphur dioxide.</p><p>But not all metals are affected by the sulphur compounds. For example, bronzes which have a patina are generally not affected by sulphur dioxide.</p><p>Materials containing cellulose—as used in the production of paper—are susceptible to damage from sulphuric acid. The widespread phenomenon of brittle books is a direct consequence of this problem.</p><p>Sulphuric acid also affects protein-based materials. One example of this is red rot—a well-documented problem in libraries—caused by sulphuric acid attacking bookbinding leathers.</p><p>Silk and photographs are affected by sulphuric acid—whether in the gaseous or liquid state.

These are very reactive and cause severe damage to most materials with which they come in contact.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ozone</strong></span></p><p>Ozone is an extremely reactive oxidising gas. It attacks organic materials at a molecular level. Because many objects in museums, galleries and libraries are organic, ozone in your environment could be disastrous.</p><div class="page" title="Page 62"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Photographs, which are usually made up of a paper support with a gelatine emulsion, are extremely susceptible to damage from ozone.</p><p>Metal corrosion is also very common in the presence of ozone.</p><p>Fortunately, ozone has a short life. Even in a polluted environment, it is likely to have reacted with the external environment before it reaches the collection storage and display areas. Unfortunately, ozone can still be produced within a museum environment—for example, by photocopiers.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Factors which increase the effect of acidic gases</strong></span></p><p>Strong visible light, continuous exposure to UV radiation, and high levels of humidity and temperature in the museum environment, all increase the effects of acidic gases on materials used in cultural objects.</p><p>For example, strong light levels can accelerate the chemical production of harmful acids in the environment as well as increase the rate of deterioration of various materials with these acids.</p><p>Some reactions are initiated by more energetic wavelengths of light and by UV radiation.</p><p>Furthermore, chemical reactions are more likely to take place and proceed faster in humid conditions and at higher temperatures. As a rough guide, a 10°C increase in temperature doubles the rate of chemical reactions.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about adverse environmental effects, please see the chapters on <a href="./cleanLightandUltravioletRadiation.html">Light and Ultraviolet Radiation</a> and on <a href="./cleanHumidityandTemperature.html">Humidity and Temperature</a> in this volume.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>

Paper is affected by acidic materials such as wood-pulp, cardboard or wood, whereas ceramics will be unaffected by these materials. The following information is provided as a guide—so that you can avoid damage caused by display and packing materials.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wood</strong></span></p><p>Different woods produce different volatile substances. For example, plantation pine gives off phenolic acid; other woods produce acetic acid.</p><p>Paper, textiles and other items which are adversely affected by acids should not be in direct contact with wood.</p><p>Lead is extremely susceptible to acids from wood, particularly from oak.

It is made from cellulose nitrate which is a very unstable material. As it degrades, it produces nitrogen oxide. Further degradation will result in spontaneous combustion of the film. And as nitrogen oxide reactions produce oxidising agents, this reaction can occur without the presence of oxygen in the air. This means that degraded cellulose nitrate can burn even under water or when smothered. Degraded cellulose nitrate becomes dark, sticky and smelly.</span></p><p>The National Film and Sound Archive has conducted a search for nitrate film in Australian collections. If you suspect you have cellulose nitrate in your collection, contact the National Film and Sound Archive, or a relevant State institution.</p><p>Cellulose nitrate was used as a coating, as a film emulsion and to make objects. It seems to be at its most unstable as film stock; however, if you suspect you have cellulose nitrate in any form seek the advice of a conservator.</p></div></div></div></div>     								</div>

									     <div class="page" title="Page 64"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Detecting the presence of pollutant gases is generally best left to the experts. But there are some simple methods that will detect pollutant gases which might affect your collection.</p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oddy tests</strong></span></p><p>Oddy tests are named after the person who devised them. They involve placing different types of metal strips in the areas where you think pollutant gases may be a problem. The effect of the gas is measured by the condition of the metal.</p><p>These tests are described in the literature (Oddy, 1975) and are a quick and easy way of checking for problems.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Draeger detector tubes</strong></span></p><p>These tubes are available commercially and there are a wide variety of tubes—each specific for a certain gas.</p><p>You will need to contact a supplier to buy these tubes. Try chemical supply companies in your area, or ring your State or Territory Environmental Pollution Authority.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Various monitors</strong></span></p><p>There are a wide range of specialist monitors and detectors on the market. Osborn (1989) provides a list of many of these. In most cases, you will need to commission an expert who is familiar with the use of the equipment to undertake an assessment and provide a report.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>pH indicator strips</strong></span></p><p>pH indicator strips are used to determine whether acidic gas is being produced in an area. When moistened with neutral pH distilled water, the strips absorb gases from the air and indicate whether acids are formed.</p><p>You will need distilled water and one or two pH indicator strips for each test you make. Test the pH of the distilled water with a pH strip. Compare the colour change on the strip with the reference chart on the case, and record the pH of the water. The water should be at pH 7: neutral. A small variation in pH—down to 6—is acceptable, because contact with carbon dioxide in air makes distilled water slightly acidic.</p><p>Leave the moist pH strip in the air for 15-30 minutes, and monitor any colour changes against the reference chart on the indicator strip case. pH indicator strips are a guide only, so further testing should be done.</p><div class="page" title="Page 65"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Check with experts</strong></span></p><p>Your local municipal offices have information about environmental pollution in your area, and may be able to help you contact local experts.</p><p>The Environment Protection Authority or similar authority in your state should be able to give you the names of professionals who can help.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>     								</div>

									     <div class="page" title="Page 65"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The protection of exposed objects from pollutant gases requires commonsense and expert knowledge.</p><p>Remember that reactions from pollutant chemicals are increased with high light levels, and changes in relative humidity and temperature. The possible impact of these factors can be reduced fairly easily. The following steps will help.</p><ul><li><p>Provide drainage channels around the base of statues and clean away accumulated organic debris.</p></li><li><p>Reduce moisture levels in and around cultural objects. Moisture in tropical climates can be more difficult to control, but you may be able to provide shelter from rain, and shade to help keep the temperature down.</p></li><li><p>Relocate an object to the least-exposed area of a building. For example, moving an object from the seaward side of a building to a more protected location will reduce, although not completely stop, the effect of salt-laden wind.</p></li><li><p>Commonsense often dictates the use of protective coatings on objects. But commonsense can be wrong. If you want to provide a protective coating on an outdoor object, then you need to consult an expert. Surface coatings applied inappropriately can do more harm than good. If the coating is to be applied to a work of art and is likely to change the finish of the work, then you should consult the artist as well.</p></li><li><p>Some metals provide their own protective layers against corrosion.

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									 <div class="page" title="Page 65"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>To develop proper strategies for the care of your objects, you will need to do much more reading and familiarise yourself with a wider body of information than it is possible to provide in this manual. Talk to as many experts as possible, and get to know the problems which are particular to your area.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Air-conditioning</strong></span></p><p>If you are thinking of installing an air- conditioning system, it is advisable to talk to small museums or institutions similar to your own. Cultural material has special requirements, and if you deal with experienced people you are likely to have fewer problems.</p><p>Pollutant gases are removed usually by water sprays or activated carbon filters. Air-conditioning systems which incorporate water sprays pass air through a sheet of water to trap pollutant gases. It is important that a system like this incorporates a dehumidifier, to maintain a stable humidity. It is important also to keep the water source clean because it could become acidic from a build-up of pollutants, and circulate humidified, acidic air onto objects.</p><p>Air-conditioning systems should be designed to correct specific temperature, relative humidity and pollution problems. They are expensive to build, install and maintain, and it’s best to consult an expert who has experience with buildings of a similar scale to yours; rather than, for example, a firm with experience in domestic air-conditioning only.</p><p>Many new buildings are designed to incorporate passive environmental control techniques within the building. Air-conditioning may not be required if your building has been designed this way and is working effectively.</p><p>If you have an existing system in the building, have it checked regularly and keep a report on its condition which can be reviewed at each subsequent examination.</p><div class="page" title="Page 66"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Activated carbon filters</strong></span></p><p>Activated carbon filters control pollution emissions by adsorbing pollutants onto their surfaces. They need to be checked regularly. Once they are saturated, they will give out pollutants—and the problem will worsen rather than improve.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Potassium permanganate</strong></span></p><p>Potassium permanganate is a good filtration system for museums (Appelbaum 1991). The system is similar to silica gel systems used for humidity control. You should seek advice from a conservator before considering this option.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Commonsense approaches</strong></span></p><p>While some options for controlling pollution require expert advice and financial outlay, there are a number of options which offer protection with little cost and effort. For example:</p><ul><li><p>use display cases and layers of storage to provide a protective local environment for the object;</p></li><li><p>frame and glaze artworks which are on display;</p></li><li><p>provide dust jackets for books;</p></li><li><p>place flat paper-based objects in Solander boxes;</p></li><li><p>provide archival-quality boxes for fragile or susceptible objects; and</p></li><li><p>cover large objects which will not fit in storage cases or boxes with appropriate sheeting, for example, unbleached and undyed cotton or linen, or Tyvek, when they are not on display.</p></li></ul><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about Tyvek, please see the chapter on <a href="./cleanTextiles.html">Textiles</a> in Cultural Material.</span></p><p>These are some options only. As you familiarise yourself with more information in other sections of reCollections, you will find that other simple options are available. Even if you can’t control the environment completely, you can make some difference with even small changes.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>
