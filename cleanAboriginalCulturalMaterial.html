									       <div class="page" title="Page 64"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Always remember to be sensitive to the cultural group, and make sure that cultural mores are respected, when handling, storing and displaying cultural heritage material.</p><p>For example, with particular Aboriginal community groups, it is appropriate to store items relating to menâ€™s business in a separate area to items relating to womenâ€™s business.</p><p>With secret or sacred material, security is importantâ€”to make sure that only the appropriate people have access to the items.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Just as there can be appropriate and inappropriate ways to store particular items, it is important to be aware that displaying these items should also be handled sensitively. For example, it may never be appropriate to place some items on general display.</p><p>If you are unsure of the appropriate way to handle, store or display any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage items in your collection, contact a curator at your State museum for further information or for contacts with the appropriate people to answer your questions.</p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ideal conditions for storage and display</strong></span></p><p>It is important to note that ideal storage conditions cannot always be achieved; nor is it always appropriate to do so, because some items are produced, and used, in extreme climates. For example, if an item has been produced recently, or stored for a considerable time, in a tropical environment, placing it in a so-called ideal environment which is much drier than the conditions it is used to, could cause extensive damage.</p><p>This section describes the ideal storage and display environment for most materials. If the ideal environment cannot be achieved, or is inappropriate, the emphasis should be on providing a stable environment.</p><p>Ideally, store all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage items in an environment where temperature is constant and moderateâ€”in the range of 18â€“22oC. If temperatures are generally outside this range in your area, it is important to keep fluctuations to a minimum and to make sure that they are gradual.</p><div class="page" title="Page 65"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Relative humidity should be constant and below 60%. Minimise fluctuations in relative humidity, and ensure that they are gradual. Fluctuations in relative humidity can cause severe distortion, cracking and splitting, and cause separation of paint layers from the objects.</p><p>Mould grows where the relative humidity is continuously above 65%, mould does not grow when relative humidity is stable and below 60%.</p><p>Keep items at risk of drying out too quickly after coming from moist conditions, in an environment where the relative humidity is in the range of 55â€“65%.</p><p>Keep items acclimatised to drier conditions in an environment where the relative humidity is in the range of 50â€“55%.</p><p>Light should be kept to the minimum necessary for the activity. Wherever possible, store items that are not on display in the dark. This reduces the risk of fading and discolouration of a range of materials.</p><p>It is necessary to have light when items are on display. The brightness of the light should be determined by the sensitivity of the particular materials to light.</p><p>For sensitive materials such as feathers, woven fabrics, dyed materials and watercolours on paper, the brightness should be 50 lux or less. For moderately sensitive materials, the brightness of the light should be 250 lux or less.</p><p>For all items the UV content of the light should be less than 30 Î¼W/lm and no greater 75 Î¼W/lm.</p><p>Protect items from dust and pollutants.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on adverse environmental effects, please see <a href="">Damage and Decay</a>.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General storage and display guidelines</strong></span></p><p>Give careful consideration to the storage site and the storage system. In ideal conditions, a good storage system in an appropriate storage site, gives added protection to your collection. If the available facilities or the local climate make it difficult to achieve the ideal conditions, selecting the storage site and maintaining a good storage system are even more critical in preventing damage to the collections.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Wherever possible, the storage and display sites should be in a central area of the building, where they are buffered from the extremes of climatic fluctuations which can be experienced near external walls or in basements and attics. The storage site should not contain any water, drain or steam pipes, particularly at ceiling level. Leaking pipes can cause a lot of damage. Basements should also be avoided, because of the risk of flooding.</p><p>The storage and display sites should be well- ventilated. This helps reduce the risk of insect and mould infestation.</p><p>Inspect and clean storage and display areas regularly. Thorough and regular cleaning helps greatly in controlling insects and mould. To detect insect infestations early, check objects regularly for signs of infestationâ€”holes and frass, that is, wood powder left by boring insects.</p><p>Donâ€™t store items in sheds, or directly on the floor.</p><p>Cover stored objects with cotton or Tyvek covers. They provide protection from dust and unnecessary exposure to light. These covers also provide some buffering against fluctuations in environmental conditions.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about Tyvek, please see the section on <a href="">Textiles</a>.</span></p><p>Always give items adequate support and try to reduce the physical stresses that can cause damage.</p><div class="page" title="Page 66"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Bark paintings should be stored flat, and any curved or warped areas supported with polystyrene-filled, cotton bags or something similar. This gives the bark the greatest overall support.</p><p>Ideally, place barks in drawers such as plan cabinets: to protect them from dust and from fluctuations and extremes in relative humidity and temperature. If suitable drawers are not available, store bark paintings on flat shelving, with support for warped or curved areas as described above.</p><p>You can consider placing each bark painting on a flat board, for example, acid-free Foam Cor, mount board or in a box, so that you can lift the item without touching the bark itself. This is particularly helpful when it is necessary to move items in storage or to have the bark painting available for study purposes.</p><p>Woven material, such as pandanus, bark string bags and baskets, should be well supported on the inside with Dacron-filled cotton bags. This helps to maintain their shape, and reduces the risk of splitting along the creases, which can occur if they are stored flat. It is wise to support them on the outside with filled, cotton bags as well.</p><p>Design similar support systems for items that are on display, especially for long-term display.</p><div class="page" title="Page 67"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Objects made with feathers and/or seeds are prone to light and insect attack. It is better to store them in large, dry, plastic containers with lids in storage system specifically made to fit the container.

This means washing down the walls with a product such as Exit Mould, and disinfecting, clean surfaces with a Glen 20 or Glen 10 spray; Glen products have a residual effect for up to 3 months.</p><div class="page" title="Page 75"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It is important to document the condition of the object before treating it. This can be a written description with an accompanying photograph. By examining the item thoroughly you will better understand the extent of the problem. For example, it is often found that mould grows initially from the back of a bark painting, where a hot, wet microclimate has developed, and the mould on the front is symptomatic of the greater problem on the back.</p><p>The method you use to clean mould from an object depends on the state of the mould. The treatment described below dries out and removes a light dusting of mould.</p><p>Place the mouldy item in a well-aired, stable atmosphere with relative humidity of 50â€“60%. This dries the mould so that it can be removed.</p><p>Drying the mould does not kill it. Unless it is removed outdoors or in a well-vented area away from the rest of the collection, the spores can spread, be deposited on other items and infect the rest of the collection.</p><p>Do not over-dry the environment. A significant drop in relative humidity can cause objects to warp, curl and crack.

This is particularly true for carved and painted wood sculptures where the paint is stable.</p><ul><li><p>Mix 7 parts industrial methylated spirits to 3 parts water in a small glass jar.</p></li><li><p>Before you begin cleaning, test an inconspicuous area using a cotton swab.</p></li></ul></div><div class="column"><ul><li>If there is no smudging of paint or colour loss, clean off the mould with damp swabs.</li><li>Change swabs regularly.</li><li>An alternative method is to dip a brush into the solution, brush the affected area with it, then remove mould residue with lint-free paper or fabric.</li><li>Allow the object to air-dry naturally.</li></ul><p>If there are any problems, consult a conservator.<br> It is also wise to see a conservator if the painted surfaces are friable and brushing the mould removes paint or if the mould growth is ingrained in the surface of the object and the bloom is still visible.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>                								</div>

									                <div class="page" title="Page 75"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The system suggested below is described in Coote, 1995.</p><p>This method is straightforward, but requires you to contour the mount to the shape of the bark. If you are not confident doing this work, ask a conservator for help, or work through it with your local framer.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Problems which can occur with inappropriate mounting systems</strong></span></p><p>Bark is subject to movement when it is placed in environments that are not controlled. This movement can happen over a short or long period of time, depending on the speed and extent of environmental changes. If a bark painting is constrained, or mounted in the wrong way, a great deal of damage can occur during this movement. In addition, if the paint is not held strongly onto the bark surface, it is more likely to flake off when the bark moves.</p><p>If a bark painting is fixed top and bottom, it tends to develop a twist.</p><p>If a wood backing has been glued in spots to the back of the bark then hung, it may develop a central warp over time.</p><p>If strips of wood are glued to the bark, it can develop a warp just below the adhesive line, which can progress into splitting or pulling away from the bark during natural movement.</p><div class="page" title="Page 76"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>In the past, barks were nailed, screwed or wired through from the front, and held onto a hard board at the back. This is now considered unethical: in the same way that any painted surface by an artist should be respected in its entirety. In addition, those areas which are unconstrained can move, split and warp as the environment changes, while the constrained areas cannot move. This can result in more damage than occurs when the whole bark is unconstrained.</p><p>A bark larger than about 750mm in length which is leant unsupported on an angle against a wall develops a curve, indicating that it cannot readily support its own weight.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A mounting system for bark paintings</strong></span></p><p>The best mount fully supports the bark and its contours, using a reversible system that does not employ adhesive contact with the bark. This system has great advantages when used in uncontrolled environments.</p><p>The system uses a padded, riveted, aluminium framework, designed to conform to the significant contours of the bark painting.</p><p>Aluminium strips of 1.6mm and 3mm thick and 200mm wide are used.</p><p>The bark is held in place at the base by appropriately coloured polyethylene-coated aluminium feet.</p><p>Strong, durable, polycarbonate clips hold the bark in place at the top and sides.</p><div class="page" title="Page 76"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>When you are constructing the mount it is important to constantly check the mount against the bark, because small movements during construction can cause problems and frustration in the final alignment.</p><p><strong>The method</strong></p><p>Assess the bark painting to determine how many horizontal and vertical support struts are needed, and the approximate placement of the clips and base feet.</p><p>A bark approximately 1100mm x 450mm needs two struts of 3mm gauge aluminium following the longitudinal direction of the bark, and three struts of the 1.6mm gauge following the radial direction of the bark.</p><p>You may have to compromise between the best structural support for the bark and the aesthetic placement of a clip over an important image on the painting.</p><div class="page" title="Page 77"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>After you have determined where the clips should be placed, mark the positions with chalk on the back of the painting.</p><p>Then place the bark painted-side down on a supporting bed of sand or Dacron-filled bags, so that all the contours of the bark are fully supported. Only proceed to this step if you are confident that the paint is well attached to the bark surface.</p><p>At this stage, the placement of the aluminium strips can be mapped out precisely.</p><p>The 3mm-thick lengths are cut with a hacksaw to the exact length of the bark.</p></div><div class="column"><p>If the bark is overly convex or concave, you will need to make some allowance in the length, to be able to slightly bend the aluminium to conform to the shape.</p><p>File and smooth the aluminium at the endsâ€”to prevent any damage to the bark.</p><p>The 1.6mm-thick lengths for the radialâ€”or horizontalâ€”strips need to be cut about 100mm over each end. This gives adequate allowance for the shaping of the aluminium to the contours of the bark in this direction.</p><p>These radial strips are then moulded by hand to the shape of the bark.</p><p>It is recommended that shaping of each strip starts from the centre and works to the sides.</p><p>Once the shape conforms well to the bark contours with allowance in the length of the strips for any curving at the edges, the strips are cut to the correct length, filed and rounded to prevent damage to the bark.</p><p>The 1.6mm aluminium can be bent readily using thumb, finger and hand pressure. Practice speeds the process and the using a vice and a pair of pliers can help. Experience shows that hand and finger pressure is often all that is required, because tools can create too sharp a bend, preventing smooth contours being formed.</p><p>When you have finished shaping the strips, lay them in place over the back of the bark, with the 1.6mm contoured strips in direct contact with the bark.</p><p>Then mark the aluminium with a fine, felt-tipped marking pen: to help in placing the drilled holes for the rivets, which will attach the aluminium strips together and attach the D-rings to the mount.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Do not drill the holes while the aluminium straping is resting on the bark. For drilling, place the aluminium strapping on a surface away from the bark. Otherwise you could damage the bark.</span></p><p>Use a rivet gun and steel-stemmed, aluminium rivets to rivet the aluminium strips together. The recommended rivet size is 10mm long with rivet diameter 3.2mm.</p><div class="page" title="Page 78"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>To prevent any distortion or movement of the system when in place, it is useful to make a double rivet at one joint. This double rivet can be put into place after all other riveting has been done and final alterations made, to ensure a good fit to the bark.</p><p>The D-rings, which are used to hang the painting, can be riveted at this stage. They are always attached to the heavier, 3mm-thick aluminium, as these are the weight-bearing struts of the system.</p><div class="page" title="Page 78"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>When the system sits snugly over the bark, holes for the polycarbonate clips can be marked and drilled along the top and sides. Remove the mount from the bark during drilling.</p><p>Depending on the weight of the bark, the finer or heavier gauge aluminium can be used to construct the feet. A length of aluminium, approximately</p><div class="page" title="Page 78"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>120mm, is cut to bend a U foot, on average, 8mm internal width and a foot 10mm front.</p><p>The length of the back depends on the needs of the joint, but would measure at least 40mm, to enable two rivets to join the foot to the base and ensure a strong joint.</p><p>An appropriately coloured, powdered, low-density, polyethylene materialâ€”LDPEâ€”can be heat-sealed onto the feet: to give a durable, aesthetically pleasing support. Alternatively, they can be covered with a coloured fabricâ€”or painted after the application of an etch prime paint. The feet are thus coloured and double-riveted to the base of the system.</p><p>Thin strips of polyethylene foamâ€”1â€“3mmâ€”are cut and glued to the inside of the aluminium system. These will be in direct contact with the bark.</p><p>The foam can be glued with a hot-melt glue applied with a glue gun.</p><p>It is important to create a fairly firm sandwich of the bark/foam/aluminium system; and different thicknesses of the foam may be needed.</p><p>When the system is ready, it can be attached to the bark by slipping the bark into the feet and clipping it into place with the polycarbonate clips.</p><p>If the system is loose at the clips, they can be glued to the aluminium struts with hot-melt glue; or extra polyethylene foam can be added to the sandwich.</p><p>The final steps are:</p><ul><li><p>removal of the pen markings with ethanol;</p></li><li><p>attachment of picture wire to the D-rings; and</p></li><li><p>hanging the bark in place.</p></li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An alternative display system</strong></span></p><p>For display purposes, a bark painting can be exhibited by leaning it against the wall, with the bottom of the bark resting on a narrow shelf. A padded L-shaped bracket can be drilled into the wall at the top centre of the bark, to secure the bark so that it cannot fall off the shelf.</p><div class="page" title="Page 79"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><strong>If you have a problem related to the care of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage items, contact a conservator.
