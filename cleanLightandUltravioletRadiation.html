As a result, various chemical reactions can take place, depending on the amount of energy delivered. These reactions are called photochemical reactions. In some cases it is very easy to see the effects of these reactions: try leaving a piece of newsprint in the sun for a few hours and examine the results. The paper becomes discoloured—yellowed. It often feels different as a result. However, most changes caused by photochemical reactions are not as quick as this nor as obvious; so it is difficult to know they are occurring. Nevertheless their effects can be devastating and ongoing.</p><p>Light causes extreme and irreversible damage to many materials, most notably organic materials—those that derive from plants and animals. In a museum, gallery or library, these will include furniture, textiles, prints, books, drawings, manuscripts, wallpaper, dyes and inks, feathers and fur.</p><figure id="attachment_1143" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-1143" src="./Light and Ultraviolet Radiation _ reCollections_files/Light-and-UV-radiation_Faded-textile.jpg" alt="This textile has been damaged by light, which has faded one half during storage or display." width="500" height="304"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This textile has been damaged by light, which has faded one half during storage or display.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, UV radiation and visible light:</p><ul><li><p>set off chemical changes in paper and textiles, which weaken and discolour them; and</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>cause inks, dyes and pigments to fade, and so seriously affect the aesthetic quality of many items.</p></li></ul><p>Infrared radiation is less energetic than UV radiation and visible light.

Some detailed examples are given below. These illustrate the extent and types of damage which are often found. You will probably recognise some of the problems.</p><p><strong>Textiles</strong></p><p>Light and UV radiation are the greatest enemies of textiles. Colours will become pale and dull, and the fabric will become fragile and will split readily.</p><div class="page" title="Page 8"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Textiles produced in the 19th century require particular care. The aniline dyes, which were first manufactured and became popular around this time, are particularly susceptible to fading, especially the purples, blues and greens.</p><p><strong>Watercolour pigments</strong></p><p>Pigments of plant or animal origin, that is organic pigments, tend to be more sensitive than others.</p><p>Photochemical action in pigments has severely altered the appearance of many watercolours. For example, Hooker’s Green is a pigment mixture that was widely used for foliage in botanical illustration and landscape watercolours. It is made up of the reasonably durable Prussian Blue mixed with Gamboge, a yellow pigment made from gum from a Cambodian tree. Gamboge is sensitive to photochemical action and fades, leaving the foliage blue.</p><p>Many of these sensitive pigments were also used in oil paintings; but because the pigment layer is usually thicker, and the oil medium offers more protection, the effects are less obvious.</p><p><strong>Paper</strong></p><p>Mass-produced, cheap, modern papers are made from untreated wood pulp. These contain lignin, the substance in trees that gives them their strength. Lignin is very reactive and is susceptible to photochemical deterioration. As lignin breaks down it produces yellow–brown substances, as seen when newspaper is left in the sun, as well as acids.</p><div class="page" title="Page 9"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The acids produced can then attack the paper fibres, making them short, and the paper brittle.</p><p>The photochemical deterioration of paper is an example of a reaction that continues even when the paper is no longer exposed to light or UV radiation.</p><p><strong>Moderately sensitive materials</strong></p><p>Although not all materials are as sensitive to photochemical reactions as those listed above, most are affected by light and UV radiation to some extent.</p><p>Materials that are moderately sensitive to light and UV radiation include:</p><ul><li><p>oil paintings;</p></li><li><p>bone and horn; and</p></li><li><p>furniture.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to consider the lighting conditions under which you store, display and use valuable items, as well as the length of exposure they get.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>          								</div>

Wherever possible, eliminate daylight completely.</p><p>If daylight is a major light source for your museum, gallery or library, take steps to diffuse and filter the light. You can:</p></div><div class="column"><ul><li>use curtains or blinds over windows and skylights; and</li><li>use UV-absorbing plastic films on windows and skylights to eliminate the UV radiation coming into the room from the daylight.</li></ul><p>If fluorescent or halogen lights are used, remember:</p><ul><li>some sort of UV-absorbing filter should be used to remove the UV radiation;</li><li>filtering can be used on the lamps or on display cases and frames; and</li><li>UV-absorbing films, acrylic sheets and lacquers are available.</li></ul><p>If you have fluorescent light fittings, remember:</p><ul><li>low UV-emitting fluorescent tubes should be used. If you use these, give instructions that the same type of tubes should be purchased when the existing ones burn out; and</li><li>low UV-emitting fluorescent tubes are more expensive than ordinary tubes. It can be tempting to replace these with cheaper and more readily available tubes. If low-UV fluorescent tubes are ever replaced with ordinary tubes, the new ones should be filtered.</li></ul><p>If you use incandescent tungsten spotlights or floodlights, remember:</p><ul><li>the intensity of the light is greater the closer the light source is to the object; and</li><li>if the light source is too close to an object, it can cause the temperature to rise, which can lead to damage.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Control light levels by design</strong></span></p><p>Lights should be on only when visitors are viewing a display.

Perspex does not allow as much UV radiation to pass through it as glass. Because the Perspex develops static electricity, it attracts the red dust which surrounds the building.

UV radiation nearly always accompanies visible light, because it is produced by the sun and by some common luminaires, such as fluorescent tubes and tungsten halide bulbs.</p><div class="page" title="Page 15"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Photochemical reactions are rarely isolated or short-lived. For example:</p><ul><li><p>sometimes a new substance, which forms as a result of the initial photochemical reaction, has sufficient energy to also react with the original substance and produce further chemical change. This is called a ‘chain reaction because the light produces not just one chemical change but a whole series of them; and</p></li><li><p>if this happens while the object is still exposed to light, a whole range of chain reactions will occur at a rapid pace.</p></li></ul><p>You should be aware that the amount of damage depends not only on the wavelength of the light, but also on the amount of light that falls on the material for the whole time it is exposed.</p><p>And remember that some of these chemical reactions continue after the exposure has stopped. The deterioration reaction does not stop when the material is placed in the dark. Light damage is cumulative.</p><p>Examples of typical deterioration of artefacts because of photochemical reactions include:</p><ul><li>dyes fading and changing colour. This is perhaps the most obvious damage caused by light and UV radiation. It can also be seen that the radiation has its greatest impact on the surface of the object, for example, dyes on the exposed side of a carpet will fade, while dyes on the unexposed side appear to retain their original colour;</li><li>watercolours fade and change colour.

									    <div class="page" title="Page 16"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>There are two common ways of making light.<br> One way is to heat something until it glows. This is the principle used for incandescent bulbs. Heating the tungsten element causes it to emit or give out light. The other way to make light is to excite something electrically so that it fluoresces. Fluorescent light tubes and television screens are examples of this method.</p><div class="page" title="Page 17"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Light from heat</strong></span></p><p>When an object is heated, it gives out light. A hot object emits a broad spectrum of light. However, the frequency and wavelength at which most of the light is emitted depends on the temperature of the object. The hotter the object, the shorter the wavelength of the energy emitted. That is, the hotter the object, the greater the energy emitted.</p><p>Observing a piece of metal in a very hot flame will demonstrate this relationship. For example, when the metal starts to heat up, it will initially glow a dull red colour. As it becomes hotter, the colour will become a brighter red, then yellow—the frequency is increasing, the wavelength becoming shorter and more energy is being transmitted. This continues, and the metal glows blue and eventually white.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Incandescent light bulbs</strong></span></p><p>Incandescent light bulbs consist of a filament of tungsten metal suspended between two electrodes inside a sealed glass bulb. The bulb is filled with an inert gas to prevent the tungsten from burning up when it gets hot. When an electric current flows between the electrodes, the tungsten is heated.</p><p>The operating temperature of incandescent light bulbs is about 2,500oC. At this temperature tungsten emits most of its light in the infrared range. This is why light bulbs get so hot. But less than 10 per cent of the energy used to power a light bulb is converted into visible light, meaning they are not very efficient. A much smaller amount of power is converted into UV radiation, making incandescent light bulbs a low emitter of UV radiation.</p><div class="page" title="Page 17"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tungsten halide bulbs</strong></span></p><p>Tungsten halide bulbs operate at a much higher temperature than incandescent light bulbs, usually at about 3,500oC. They emit more light in the visible range, and so are brighter light sources than ordinary incandescent bulbs. They also emit more UV radiation than incandescent light bulbs.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 17"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The sun</strong></span></p><p>The sun also emits light because it is a hot object. Its surface temperature is approximately 6,000oC. At this temperature, the sun emits not just heat, but also a tremendous amount of light at higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths than an incandescent light bulb.</p><p>Overall, the sun emits about 9 per cent of its light in the UV range, 41 per cent in the visible light range and 50 per cent in the infrared range.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fluorescence</strong></span></p><p>Fluorescent lights work because some materials fluoresce, that is, they absorb radiation at one frequency and then give it out at another frequency.</p><p>The materials used in fluorescent lights are known as phosphors. Different phosphors are selected for use in fluorescent tubes, depending on the specific frequencies of the light they emit.</p><p>The inside of the tube is coated with the selected phosphors. A gas inside the tube becomes excited when the electric current is switched on. The excited gas emits light, which is absorbed by the phosphors and re-emitted at a different frequency.</p><p>The sharp peaks of a fluorescent spectrum are made up of light emitted by both the phosphors and the gas. The material becomes hot during this process, so that it also emits some light in the same way as hot objects.</p><p></p><div class="page" title="Page 18"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The main advantage of fluorescent lights is that they are very efficient at converting electrical energy into light. This is because most of the power goes into generating light at a few specific frequencies, rather than generating energy over a wider range of frequencies, as incandescent bulbs do. This means that fluorescent lights do not waste energy-producing infrared radiation or heat, as incandescent lights do. Fluorescent lights are therefore cooler and cheaper to run, and last longer.</p><p>By selecting particular combinations of phosphors, lighting manufacturers can determine the type of light a fluorescent tube emits. This characteristic is an important consideration when choosing your light source. If fluorescent lighting is to be used in museums, galleries and libraries, care must be taken to select only those types of tubes which emit very little ultraviolet light.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>    								</div>
