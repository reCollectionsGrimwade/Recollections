While a cupboard is a suitable storage space, mobile disaster kits or bins are commonly used. The purpose is to have ready access to resources for dealing with minor water damage.</p><p>Disaster stores are also commonly found in larger organisations. These are usually rooms dedicated<br> to holding more extensive supplies for disaster recovery, including stock to replenish the disaster bins. The choice between bin or store, location and number will vary according to your needs.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A practised team</strong></span></p><p>The third step in preparedness is getting some practice before the event, so that the procedures you have developed become second nature.</p><p>All staff should be trained in the use of fire extinguishers. All people likely to be available in the event of a disaster should also be trained in handling and treating different types of wet material. Running a simulated disaster is an effective way of checking how well prepared your organisation is.</p><p>It is advisable to form a disaster response team: to respond when a disaster is reported, to assess the situation and plan the recovery phase. Many tasks must be undertaken before and during the recovery, so it will be important to assign team members specific responsibilities.</p><p>In the event of damage to the collection, you need to form recovery teams as well. These are often made up of volunteers, led by a member of the disaster response team. They undertake the recovery procedures.</p><p>If you have only a few people to call on, or if budgets for materials are very tight, regional networks should be established with similar organisations— so that you can pool scarce resources. Networks should also be established with services to help in the event of a disaster. These include the local fire brigade, regional emergency services and companies with freezing facilities, such as butchers or ice works. You need to explain to them the emergency procedures outlined in your counter-disaster plan.</p></div></div></div></div>           								</div>

									           <div class="page" title="Page 61"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Before commencing the recovery phase, produce a recovery plan. This documents the order in which you are going to recover damaged items, and how you propose to treat them. Options may vary from simply moving items into a drying area, to packing them for freezing. Unlike the counter-disaster plan, the recovery plan cannot be prepared ahead of time. It will vary, depending on the situation.</p><p>Having documented the recovery plan, it is time to assemble the recovery work-teams and brief them on the tasks to be done. In addition to clarifying your expectations of them, it is important to cover safety issues.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recovery</strong></span></p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Recovery includes:</p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>sorting: grouping materials by type after the disaster. Materials are stored by the type of damage, for example, water, fire; by the extent of damage, for example, wet, damp; and by the type of material, for example, photographic, textiles;</p><p>documenting: maintaining a written record of the original location of items, where they are moved, and what treatment they are to undergo. The aim is to allow prompt retrieval of an item, should it be requested, and to keep a record for insurance purposes of all materials disposed of; </p><div class="page" title="Page 62"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li><p>drying: air-drying wet material by removing visible water, and placing items in an area which has a good supply of clean, cold, moving air. Fans are often used to stimulate air movement;</p></li><li><p>cleaning: removing mud, dust or dirt from the surface of an item;</p></li><li><p>rehousing: replacing damaged boxes and folders;</p></li><li><p>repairing: the application of treatments to make a damaged item structurally sound; and</p></li><li><p>relabelling damaged items: replacing damaged or missing labels. Labels are often detached during a disaster, and/or the inks run and become difficult to read.</p></li></ul><p>The recovery operation must be planned to suit the needs of the particular situation and of the damaged materials. The recovery operation is not complete until all items are back in the storage area and available for use.</p><p>Ideally, the recovery operation begins after the disaster has been contained. However, where particularly vulnerable items are damaged, or at risk, it may be necessary to begin the recovery operation before this point. Consider the following situation. A water pipe has burst and water is spraying over the part of the storage area in which costumes are held. As the costumes are likely to have soluble dyes, you may decide to move the costumes which are in the vicinity of the water before turning off the water. It depends on how easy it is to turn off the water supply.</p><p>Recovery follows the preparation of a recovery plan. Usually there is more than one type of salvage procedure that can be employed, depending on the nature and extent of the disaster. Recovery may take a few days, or even months, before it is complete, depending on the extent of the disaster. In examples like the Florence floods of 1966, in which vast numbers of rare and irreplaceable books and manuscripts were affected, the recovery phase has still not been completed. It is advisable to seek advice from a recovery specialist when recovering from a disaster.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recovery priorities</strong></span></p><p>Ensure that the disaster area is cordoned off to prevent sightseers from getting underfoot, and to</p></div><div class="column"><p>secure the area from pilfering. Security must not be overlooked, because there can be many people other than staff in the building. It is very easy for some unscrupulous person to walk out with items from the collection. Make sure that a register is set up to record the name and associated company of every person who enters the building, and secure unaffected areas so that people cannot wander through them.</p><p>After preparing the work areas for sorting, packing and drying, the different materials should be treated in order of the priority lists set out in your recovery plan, and depending on the extent of damage and their sensitivity to water.</p><p>It is usual to consider the wettest material first, and to look for items which may have water-soluble media or which may suffer structural damage from swelling—as is the case for canvas paintings and furniture. With mixed collections such as those often found in historical societies, it is important to identify the items most sensitive to water. Seek assistance from a recovery specialist on this matter, because they will vary with each collection.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recovery procedures for different materials</strong></span></p><p>It should be noted that 95% of all disasters result in water-damaged materials, and mould will develop within two to three days in a warm, humid environment. Fire will result in water damage from sprinklers or fire hoses; earthquakes and tremors often cause water pipes to crack and/or burst.</p><p>So the emphasis in this chapter is on recovery procedures for water-damaged items. Tips on the treatment of items affected by fire and smoke are also included. The typical types of damage vary, depending on the materials.</p><p>You should also note that water is usually not clean, so there may be accompanying staining. Water from sprinklers is usually rusty; and flood- water may contain mud, oil and sewage.</p><p>Different types of materials have different drying requirements. The recovery procedures for electronic media, microforms, colour photographic materials, black and white photographic materials, glass plate negatives, and historical photographic materials differ quite dramatically from those for paper-based items such as documents, books, maps, plans and posters. See Procedures for the recovery of particular types of materials later in this chapter.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>           								</div>

The affected area becomes powdery, and will disintegrate if handled.</p><p>To prevent or minimise further mould growth, first control the environment. The temperature and relative humidity in the disaster area should be stabilised; ideally, the area should be kept at 20°C and 50%RH. You may need to install dehumidifiers and fans—cold cycle only—to help circulate the air. Recovery specialists should be contacted for further advice.</p><p>Mould-damaged items should be removed from the storage area as soon as they are identified. Every effort must be made to minimise the chance of other items becoming affected. There are several options for the treatment of mould-affected material.</p><p>Mould-damaged materials have traditionally been fumigated to kill the mould. But most fumigation chemicals used in the past are either extremely toxic or ineffective, and are no longer recommended for use. Check with a recovery specialist about the suitability of using specific fumigants, because some can cause harm to certain materials. It is critically important to prevent mould from growing.</p><p>Freezing will not kill mould, but will prevent further growth, giving you extra time to seek further advice.</p><p>An alternative is simply to vacuum the material, stabilise the humidity in the storage area and continue to monitor it for further outbreaks.</p><p>Remember that mould growth is retarded by reducing the humidity to 60%RH or less, and by ensuring good air circulation.</p><div class="page" title="Page 67"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Regardless of which option you choose, mould- affected material must be cleaned before returning it to storage.

If there is time, every second book should be wrapped loosely in waxed paper or freezer paper to prevent the books sticking, and to stop colours running from one item to the next.</p><p>Flat items should be supported between boards, or inside a container. Heavy weights should not be placed on top of frozen flat items. If putting more than one flat item between a set of boards, interleave them with a material to allow them to be easily separated: Reemay or freezer paper, for example.</p><p>The materials should be frozen in the containers in which they are packed. Blast-freezing is preferred, because the speed of this process minimises the chance of ice crystals forming. The freezer should be maintained at minus 10°C or below.

This paper, and any interleaving, is changed regularly to improve drying.</p><p>Prompt removal of damp rubbish, such as replaced paper towel, wet mounts and boxes, can help keep the humidity down.</p><p>Shape three-dimensional objects such as historic costume and leather objects correctly while they dry, to minimise distortion. Nylon netting can be used to pad out three-dimensional objects.</p><p>Dehumidifiers can be installed to assist the drying process. These are electrical machines that reduce humidity in the atmosphere. Some models have a chamber where the condensed water collects. This needs to be emptied regularly, often twice a day, morning and afternoon. If not emptied, the machine has a fail-safe mechanism to stop it operating when the chamber is full, thus preventing overflow. But the humidity increases when the machine is idle. Different models of dehumidifiers have different capacities; you may need to check how many units are needed for the room area. For example, two units would be needed if using a portable refrigerant model like the Oasis 2700 in a room of 50 square metres.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 77"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Freeze-drying</strong></span></p><p>Freeze-drying is a process in which pre-frozen materials are dried without the ice melting. This is called sublimation. The frozen items are placed in a freeze-dry chamber. Then the air is removed from the chamber, creating a vacuum. Mild heat is introduced to speed up the drying process; and the ice crystals sublimate to water-vapour, which is pumped out of the chamber. This has the advantage that books and coated paper do not stick together as a result of drying, and water- soluble media like inks do not feather any more than they have already.</p><p>It should be noted that if inks have already bled, the stain will be set, and pages which have started to block or stick together will not release as a result of the drying process. Items will dry in the shape they were in, which means that a book may dry with a distorted or warped cover and cockled or wrinkled paper.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vacuum-drying</strong></span></p><p>Vacuum-drying is used to dry wet—not frozen— material, by evaporation. Wet materials are placed in a vacuum chamber, and the air is removed to create a vacuum. Heat can be used to speed up the drying.</p><p>Freeze-drying and vacuum-drying are good options when a large number of items is involved. Staining and smoke odour are reduced. Coated paper has been successfully salvaged using both these methods.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Frozen material can be dried in a vacuum chamber but the material will thaw, carrying the risk of bleeding inks and blocking of coated paper.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Photographic materials should not be dried by either of these methods.</span></p></div></div></div></div>         								</div>

If you don’t have felt, use additional layers of blotting paper to cushion the peaks of impasto. The higher the impasto, the thicker the padding needs to be.</p><p>Place a sheet of Perspex or Masonite on top. This final layer should be larger than the object underneath.</p><p>Weight the package, taking care to distribute the weights evenly.</p><div class="page" title="Page 82"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Textiles</strong></span></p><p>Freeze wet textiles if they are stained, or the if dyes are bleeding, or if drying can’t be done quickly.</p><p>Do not hang wet woollen or silk items.</p><p>Do not carry wet textiles without some sort of support, because they are heavier when wet, and can tear. Textiles can be placed on Nylon netting, to be carried.</p><p>Lay objects out flat on polyester screens or blotting paper to dry.</p><p>Place wads of bunched-up Nylon netting inside garments. This improves air flow inside them, and therefore aids drying. It also holds them in shape and minimises the risk of distortion.</p><p>Set up cold air fans to assist drying.</p><p>Call a recovery specialist if any further treatment is needed.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Works of art on paper</strong></span></p><p>Carefully remove works from their frames.</p><p>If the medium is pastel or oil, place the work face- up on a sheet of blotting paper, and allow it to air-dry.</p><p>If the medium appears soluble, support the item between Reemay and boards, then freeze.</p><p>Alternatively, place it between sheets of blotting paper and dry it under a pressing board.</p><p><strong>If you have a problem relating to hazard assessment or other similar matters, contact a conservator. Conservators can offer advice and practical solutions.</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

People get very tired working in difficult conditions and can be quite emotional after a disaster. Therefore it is important to rotate jobs and have breaks from the work— these should happen every hour. Refreshments and food should be provided for the volunteers by the host organisation. It is also important to brief people properly before they commence the recovery phase. They will need clear instructions backed up by demonstrations of their tasks.
