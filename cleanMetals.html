A metal becomes a solid at a certain temperature; and the atoms of the metal settle into a characteristic, well ordered configuration.

These combinations are called alloys.

Physical damage to metal objects can leave them vulnerable to corrosion. For example, a scratch in tin plate leads to corrosion of the base metal.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Corrosion</strong></span></p><p>The tarnishing or corrosion of metals will be your major problem if you are responsible for the care of metal items.</p><p>Gold, silver and copper are the only metals that are stable enough to be found in their natural metallic state. All other metals are more stable when combined with other elements, to form oxides, sulphides, chlorides, carbonates or mixtures of these.</p><p>There is a natural tendency for most pure metals to return to their more stable, corroded states.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Because of this, metal objects need to be protected from environmental conditions and pollutants which encourage corrosion.</p><p>In some cases—as the metal corrodes—the oxide film that forms acts as an insulating barrier, which slows the rate of corrosion to an acceptable level. Copper and aluminium are two metals in which oxide coatings form protective layers—called passivating layers. When iron corrodes, however, it does not usually form a protective film. Iron continues to corrode until no metal is left, unless some other protective coating is applied to protect it from the elements.</p><p>It is important to note also that corrosion builds up on top of the metal surface, and is often much thicker than the original metal. You may find that when you come to treat an object there is little or no original metal remaining; and removing the corrosion products could mean ending up with a much reduced object or none at all.</p><p><strong>Causes of corrosion</strong></p><p>Moisture and oxygen are required for metals to corrode.</p><p>Chloride ions, which are found in common salt— sodium chloride—can speed up the corrosion rate, and are also capable of penetrating protective oxide layers.</p><p>Fats, oils and sweat can also enhance corrosion.</p><p>Acids formed when air pollutants combine with moisture will attack metals. Outdoor monuments and sculptures are particularly vulnerable to this type of attack.</p><p>Relatively unreactive metals, such as copper and silver, can suffer significant corrosion if sulphide- containing materials are in the same environment as the metal.</p><p>These sulphide pollutants are usually associated with the breakdown of plant matter, and the decomposition of sulphur-containing proteins such as wool. A common pollutant is carbonyl sulphide—COS.</p><p>Dust absorbs moisture readily. So areas with a build-up of dust can have quite high local humidity—higher than the surrounding environment. Dust will absorb pollutants and other reactive materials as well.</p></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 85"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Corrosion also occurs if dissimilar alloys and metals come into contact with each other. This type of corrosion is called galvanic corrosion.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the more reactive metal or alloy corrodes while the less reactive metal is protected. For example, if iron and copper were in direct physical contact in the presence of moisture and oxygen, then the iron would selectively corrode while simultaneously protecting the copper.</p><p>This problem can be overcome by avoiding direct contact between dissimilar metals. This will not be simple if the metals are components of the same object.</p><p>The oxide film which forms on particular metals acts as an insulating barrier or passivating layer barrier, slowing the rate of corrosion to an acceptable level. This type of passivation occurs with copper and aluminium.</p><p>When looking at the way in which artefacts have corroded and when deciding on management strategies, it is important to ask these basic questions: is it necessary to treat an object? or can the causes of deterioration be controlled?</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on the effects of humidity, dust and pollutants, please refer to <a href="./index.html">Damage and Decay</a>.</span></p></div></div></div></div>                 								</div>

Silver is often used for coins, jewellery and cutlery.</p><p>Most silver items found in Australia will be either sterling silver or plated silver.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sterling silver</strong></span></p><p>Sterling silver is the standard alloy used in jewellery and cutlery. It is made up of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. The addition of copper to silver increases hardness of the alloy, without any significant loss of lustre or colour.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Plated silver</strong></span></p><p>The two common forms of plated silver are Sheffield plate and silver plate/electroplate.</p><p>Sheffield plate is made by fusion-bonding— sweating sterling silver to both sides of a copper or brass sheet; it is then worked to produce the desired object.</p><p>Silver plate or electroplate is formed when a thin layer of pure or sterling silver is deposited electrolytically on the surface of a base metal. Common base metals include copper, brass, nickel silver—an alloy of copper, zinc and nickel—and Britannia metal—a tin alloy with 5–10% antimony.</p><p>Electroplated materials are often stamped EPNS for electroplated nickel or silver, or EPBM for electroplated Britannia metal.</p><p>As commercial electroplating was developed in the 1840s, it is likely that a lot of the materials in the collections of local museums in Australia will be made of silver plate.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Signs of corrosion on silver</strong></span></p><p>Silver artefacts tarnish if they are not kept polished. The silver surface changes through a faint purplish hue to a deep black. The tarnish is a layer of silver sulphide.</p><div class="page" title="Page 90"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Artefacts excavated from underground or from the sea may be coated with grey silver chloride and copper corrosion products. If these materials have been exposed to sunlight, the surface will have a purplish tinge.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cleaning silver</strong></span></p><p>Clean silver only when absolutely necessary, and not as a routine treatment. This is because any cleaning removes minute amounts of silver.</p><p>Take great care to differentiate between tarnish and decorative treatments which are an inherent part of the object and which would be destroyed by cleaning. For example, a decorative treatment which should not be removed is niello, a black silver sulphide/silver copper sulphide that is used deliberately to highlight engraved sections of silver jewellery.</p><p>Avoid abrasive cleaners. They can cause fine scratching of the surface and remove small amounts of silver.</p><p>There are a number of proprietary brands of silver dip solutions available, which readily remove tarnish. These are usually made up of thiourea and acid mixtures. Silver dips should be used only when the object is badly tarnished.</p><p>If you decide to use a silver dip, apply the solution, or dip the object, only for as long as it takes to remove the tarnish.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Then rinse the object in hot water to remove residues, and dry it with a lint-free cloth. After drying, a final polish with a silver cloth will put a thin layer of corrosion inhibitors on the surface of the silver.</p><p>If Sheffield plate is in reasonable condition, it needs no further treatment other than being wiped with a silver cloth and displayed or stored under conditions of low relative humidity and away from wool.</p><p>Although there are commercially available solutions which gradually redeposit small amounts of silver on worn areas, these should be used only after considering the history and function of the object.</p><p>On no account should the object be replated. This completely devalues the object by removing the technological evidence of its manufacture.</p><p>Electroplated or silver plated objects which are in good condition, but on which the silver has been worn away to reveal underlying metal, can be restored by using a solution such as the one described above. This is a better way to rejuvenate the surface than the standard electroplating, which is a lot more costly and not always successful.</p><p>If the piece is in good condition, then it is better to maintain it in that condition, rather than continually cleaning it and wearing down the silver coating. Wiping with a silver cloth, followed by storage and display under conditions of low relative humidity and low pollution levels is the simplest method of protection.</p><p>Despite the best storage, display and care methods, all electroplated silver will eventually show pin-pricks of corrosion as the plating wears thin. Once the plating has been perforated, the underlying metal is prone to pitting corrosion; and the surface will gradually become covered with blotchy, black and green-blue areas of corrosion.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1095" src="./Metals _ reCollections_files/40-metal-perferations-rcoll.jpg" alt="40---metal-perferations---rcoll" width="507" height="300"></p><div class="page" title="Page 91"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Simple care techniques don’t have much effect on this type of problem. It needs more complex treatment.</p><ul><li><p>Immerse the object in a solution of 10g of thiourea and 50g of citric acid in 1 litre of water. This treatment will clean the object and remove the silver corrosion products.</p></li><li><p>After cleaning, the object must be placed in a diluted bath of sodium carbonate, 1% by weight in water, and left to soak for an hour or so to remove any citric acid from beneath the electroplate—to make sure that no further corrosion occurs. Follow this with a final wash in fresh, deionised or distilled water.</p></li><li><p>If the corrosion damage is not too severe, then the underlying metal can be re-touched using one of the silver solutions which redeposit small amounts of silver on worn areas. Finally, polish the object with a silver cloth.</p></li></ul><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Check your chemical safety data sheets, and take the appropriate precautions.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Coating silver</strong></span></p><p>There are lacquers available for coating silver objects, and these can significantly slow down tarnishing processes.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">These lacquers can be difficult to remove if they break down. And unless an even coating is applied, a patchy and blotchy tarnish may develop on the surface. Consult a conservator before coating your silver objects.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storing and displaying silver</strong></span></p><p>The general handling, storage and display guidelines apply to silver objects.</p><p>If you must place a silver object in a display case which has previously been shown to be corrosive towards silver, add zinc oxide or an acid-free zinc carbonate blotter to the base of the case to absorb the damaging substances. This will help to keep tarnishing to a minimum.</p><p>Alternatively, you could use the commercially available sintered zinc oxide pellets, or sachets of multi-metal vapour phase corrosion inhibitors.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>               								</div>

Any attempt to chemically clean these objects renders them worthless.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Corrosion of copper</strong></span></p><p>The types of corrosion products formed on copper and its alloys depend on the environment and the metal’s composition.</p><p>The most common corrosion products are copper oxides, basic copper sulphates and basic copper carbonates. These are generally stable, and protect the underlying metal from further corrosion.</p><p>The corrosion products are sometimes produced artificially—to give the attractive green-brown patina seen on outdoor bronze statues.</p><p>The passivating layers of copper corrosion products tend to break down in the presence of chlorides. Whether the chlorides are derived from the sea or from ground water, the overall impact—accelerated corrosion—is the same.</p><p>In a humid environment, the presence of chlorides in copper alloys can cause the development of the cyclic corrosion phenomenon known as bronze disease. This type of corrosion is characterised by the presence of a light blue-green, crumbly outgrowth on the surface. If this is brushed away, a pit will be evident on the surface. To determine whether an object is affected by bronze disease, consult a conservator.</p><p>It is important to note the difference between bronze disease and a natural patina. Many bronzes are formulated specifically to obtain a certain coloured patina. If you are not sure, consult a conservator before attempting any treatment. This is particularly important for Japanese and Chinese bronzes, and for bronzes from the Renaissance period onwards, as the patinas of these objects are intrinsic to the objects and should not be removed.</p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What causes the corrosion of copper?</strong></span></p><p>Constant high humidity, pollutants such as sulphide gases, acids and careless handling causing physical damage can all cause deterioration of copper-based objects. In addition, heating and acidic cleaning solutions can etch the zinc out of brasses—leaving a copper-red discolouration on the surface.</p><p>Copper and copper alloys which have been buried or recovered from a wet site can suffer from the effects of chloride salts, resulting in the development of bronze disease.</p><p>Objects may also have special surface coatings, such as lacquers, which can be damaged easily by scratching or improper cleaning.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cleaning copper and copper alloys</strong></span></p><p>Items which are in good condition need only be wiped with a dry cloth.</p><p>Alcohol, preferably ethanol, may be used to remove greasy stains, but only after spot-testing to ensure there are no surface coatings that will be affected by this solvent.</p><p>If a badly tarnished copper alloy must be cleaned, immerse it in a solution of 10g of thiourea and 50g of citric acid in 1 litre of distilled water. This treatment will clean the object and remove the corrosion products.</p><p>The thiourea is an inhibitor which prevents any chemical attack on the metal itself. If thiourea is not used in the treatment solution, dissolved copper will be redeposited on the surface of the object, leaving a salmon-pink blush on the surface. This then has to be removed by polishing.</p><p>Leave the object in the solution until it is clean. This can take from several minutes to several hours, depending on the condition of the object.</p><div class="page" title="Page 93"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>You can speed up the treatment by brushing the surface, under running water, with a soft bristle brush, for example, toothbrush or soft Nylon, bristle brush. If necessary, a fine pumice powder can be used as a mild abrasive.</p><p>If this solution is not effective in removing tarnish, then the amounts of citric acid and thiourea used in solution can be increased to up to twice the strength.</p><p>The object must then be thoroughly washed to remove all traces of acid. This can be done under running water, or by immersion in baths of clean water.</p><p>If the object has been soaking for a considerable time or is porous, immerse it in a weak sodium carbonate bath—5g in 1 litre of water—in order to neutralise any remaining acid.</p><p>To ensure that washing has been effective, the pH of the surface of the metal object and that of the wash-water should be checked. The pH should be very close to 7, that is, close to neutral.</p></div><div class="column"><p>After washing, and before applying any protective coating, it is essential to make sure that the surface is free from grease and water. Any such contamination will show up later as corrosion areas.</p><p>Wear rubber gloves when cleaning and coating the artefacts.</p><p>If oven-drying at 100°C is not appropriate, the object can be dried by painting it liberally with acetone. The acetone drives out water in crevices and cracks, ensuring that the metal is fully dry.</p><p>The metal is considered dry when there is no longer any smell of acetone.</p><p>It is not appropriate to use acetone on composite materials or painted surfaces. To dry composite objects and painted objects, use a hair drier on a cold setting.</p><p>Note that this cleaning procedure will not produce a bright, shiny surface finish to the metal. If this is required, a proprietary metal polish can be used. Repeated polishing should be avoided, however, because it wears the metal surface.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Check your chemical safety data sheets and take the appropriate precautions.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Coating copper and copper alloys</strong></span></p><p>A protective coating can be applied, to maintain a clean, shiny surface on copper-based objects.</p><p>Lacquers and waxes are commonly used for this purpose. The patinas—excluding bronze disease— that form on bronze and copper objects are attractive and stable, and do not need a protective coating unless they are in a harsh environment.</p><p>Do not get dirt or fingerprints on the object between the cleaning and coating stages—any such contamination shows up later in the form of corrosion areas.</p><p>For coating, apply a microcrystalline-polyethylene wax preparation. An alternative coating is an acrylic lacquer containing a corrosion inhibitor. This is most satisfactory in preventing retarnishing of bronze and copper. Incralac is a commercially available lacquer which is available in a spray can or as a brush-on paint. This product can be removed with acetone.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>                 								</div>

									             <div class="page" title="Page 101"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The overall driving forces of nature work to return metals to their stable oxidised states, that is, combined with oxygen, sulphates, carbonates, sulphides and chlorides. Unoxidised or native metallic element is produced when metals are unbound from their compounds with oxygen, sulphate, carbonate, sulphide and chloride. For this to happen there must be a sufficient driving force available through a high energy intervention. This intervention can be a carbon reduction or smelting. When metal ores are processed to produce metals, they start to corrode.</p><p>The primary property of electrical conductivity of metals is due to the dispersed nature of the electrons in the structure of the metals. When an external voltage is applied to a metal, the electrons flow. This very same useful property is the underlying cause for the corrosion of metals, because the voltage applied to the metal by the presence of oxygen in a moist environment will cause the electrons to flow irreversibly from the metal into the oxygen—to form an oxide coating.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A simple overview of corrosion</strong></span></p><p>The corrosion of metals consists of two separate reactions:</p><div class="page" title="Page 102"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li><p>an oxidation reaction; and</p></li><li><p>a reduction reaction.</p></li></ul><p>To explain these reactions, it is necessary to give a simple overview of the structure of atoms. Atoms are made up of a nucleus which contains neutral particles called neutrons and positively charged particles called protons. Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, orbit around the nucleus of the atom. The number and activity of the electrons will determine how readily the atoms will react with other atoms. Many metals, because of the way their molecules are structured, can readily lose electrons. When they do this, they are no longer atoms. They are positively charged and are called ions. Because of the charge, ions are not stable and combine readily to achieve a stable, electrically neutral state.</p><p>An oxidation reaction is one in which an atom loses electrons. This can be represented very simply by the equation:</p><p>For example, copper—Cu—can be put into this equation. In an oxidation reaction:</p><p>&nbsp;<img class="alignnone wp-image-1097" src="./Metals _ reCollections_files/41a-equations-rcoll.jpg" alt="41a---equations---rcoll" width="400" height="101"></p><ul><li>Cu Cu+ + e-</li><li>It can be oxidised further: • Cu+ Cu2+ + 2e-</li></ul><p>Copper is described as polyvalent, that is, it has different combining powers: a Cu+ ion needs one negative ion to achieve a stable state, while a Cu2+ ion needs two negative ions to form neutral compounds. Once these ions combine with other substances, they produce cuprous and cupric compounds respectively. For example, Cu2O is cuprous oxide or copper (I) oxide and CuO is cupric oxide or copper (II) oxide.</p><p>Iron and zinc are other examples of polyvalent metals.</p><p>In reduction reactions, atoms gain electrons. A simple representation of this would be:</p><p></p></div><div class="column"><p>These electrolytic reactions are used to produce solid metals from their ionic solutions. The negative ions can be supplied by a range of materials. For example, if the metal object is in a seaside location, chloride ions—Cl-—will combine readily with the metal ions.</p><p>They will also combine with:</p><ul><li><p>sulphides—SO3-—sulphates—SO42—nitrates—</p><p>NO32-—from atmospheric pollutants; and</p></li><li><p>oxygen.</p></li></ul><p>If the metal combines with oxygen, it forms a metal oxide on the surface of the metal. If this metal oxide is continuous, then the overall corrosion rate of the underlying metal will slow down and it will become passivated or protected.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Corrosion cells</strong></span></p><p>Corrosion cells are small areas on metal objects where electrical differences are set up. Electrons flow between the charged areas, just as an electrical current flows between the positively and negatively charged electrodes of a battery.</p><p>A corrosion cell is an electrochemical cell which acts very much like a battery. The corrosion of metals consists of two separate reactions:</p><ul><li><p>oxidation. The oxidation reactions are called anodic reactions; and</p></li><li><p>reduction. The reduction reactions are called cathodic reactions.</p></li></ul><p>In an electrochemical cell the anodic, oxidation, half of the cell produces electrons as the metal is oxidised, while at the cathodic half of the cell, reduction occurs. The electrons are taken and held by the oxidising agent, which in aerated environments is oxygen.</p><p>In a corrosion cell, these reactions can continue in a cycle. The localised corrosion activity causes pitting in the metal.</p><p>The rate at which the electrons move out of the metal and across into the oxygen molecules is the principal factor controlling the overall corrosion rate.</p><div class="page" title="Page 103"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fats, oils and sweat</strong></span></p><p>Organic acids—formed by the oxidation of oils and fats—are capable of attacking metals which rely on a protective oxide coating to produce a good corrosion resistance. To prevent this type of damage, avoid direct contact between the object and the source of the organic material. Some examples of this type of damage are leather objects with copper fittings. The gradual deterioration of old candle wax in leather- lubricating oils leads to organic acids penetrating the protective copper oxide film, and reacting with the underlying metal—to form outgrowths of bright green organic copper compounds.</p><p>Human sweat on metal objects causes corrosion. Bacterial reactions with sweat can produce sulphides as metabolic by-products, and convert inherently inert sulphate ions into reactive sulphide ions.</p><p>Uneven coatings of oil—from sweaty hands for instance—can alter the ease of access of oxygen to metal surfaces. This has two major effects. It hinders the formation of passivating layers of corrosion. It also alters the relative reactivities of areas of the metals; and so it causes one part of the metal to corrode at the expense of another.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acids</strong></span></p><p>Inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid—derived from the decay of plastics like polyvinyl chloride— and nitric and sulphuric acids—derived from air pollution—will attack metals which are either in the same storage environment as the plastic or in the open air.</p><p>Anything that prevents direct contact between the metal surface and acidic solutions helps to prolong the life of the object. Therefore, vapour phase inhibitors, lacquers, waxes and other coatings minimise the damage from air pollution. The filtering of external air also greatly helps to minimise corrosion damage.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sulphide pollutants</strong></span></p><p>Normally unreactive metals such as copper and silver can suffer significant corrosion in the presence of sulphide ions. Common sources of sulphide ions are:</p></div><div class="column"><ul><li>hydrogen sulphide—H2S—from the anaerobic decay of plant material; and</li><li>carbonyl sulphide—COS—from the degradation of sulphur-containing proteins, such as those found in wool.</li></ul><p>Base metals such as zinc and tin are also significantly affected by sulphide pollution and/or contamination. Small concentrations of sulphur compounds in damp, oxygenated conditions cause corrosion. The resulting metal sulphides can often form a protective patina, as in the case of tin sulphides which protect pewter objects.</p><p>Adsorption of the sulphur-containing species is an essential step in the overall corrosion process and any factor which inhibits adsorption helps minimise attack on the metal. Therefore, adsorption of organic materials, such as vapour phase corrosion inhibitors, greatly decreases the corrosion rate.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>             								</div>

If the humidity is not lowered, or if some other form of treatment is not given to the object, then extensive corrosion and gross disfigurement of the object is inevitable.</p><p>One of the problems associated with bronze disease is that after the surface has been pitted, it is difficult to disguise that area, unless it is in- filled with coloured wax or some other suitable resinous material.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment of bronze disease</strong></span></p><p>The main aim of treating bronze disease is to remove all of the chlorides from the object.</p><p>This is done simply and effectively by immersing the object completely in a solution of 10g of sodium carbonate and 10g of sodium bicarbonate in 1 litre of distilled or deionised water.</p></div><div class="column"><p>A first wash of two to four months, followed by a second wash of four to six months in the solution is normally sufficient.</p><p>If the object originally had a bright metal surface, this treatment will produce a green-brown patina which is attractive and stable.</p><p>If a clean, metal surface is desired, the patina can be removed after treatment—using the citric acid stripping process or by polishing.</p><p>This method is effective for all cases of bronze disease, but the time required varies greatly from object to object.</p><p>Remove any protective coating on the object before treatment.</p><p>This treatment should be carried out by a conservator, or in close consultation with a conservator.</p><p>After removing the chlorides, apply a finishing treatment. Wax impregnation, a coating with benzotriazole or a coating with Incralac are commonly used.</p><p>Benzotriazole is one of a number of corrosion inhibitors for copper and its alloys. The reaction mechanisms are complex, but the primary protection is due to the formation of a very stable complex with copper, which protects the metal from further corrosion. Benzotriazole displaces chloride ions from cuprous chloride—this overcomes one of the fundamental causes of accelerated corrosion.</p><p>Microcrystalline/polyethylene wax</p><p>This is a good recipe:</p><ul><li><p>100g of microcrystalline wax</p></li><li><p>25g of polyethylene wax</p></li><li><p>230g of white spirits</p></li></ul><p>Melt the waxes together and stir well to make sure they are mixed thoroughly. Quickly pour the molten mixture into the white spirits and stir it constantly while it cools. This makes a smooth, white paste. The sheen of the resultant wax film can be altered by varying either the grades or the proportions of the waxes used. When it is dry, the wax can be polished, for a shiny finish, or left untouched for a matt finish. If subsequent treatment is be necessary, this wax can be removed with white spirit.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>      								</div>
