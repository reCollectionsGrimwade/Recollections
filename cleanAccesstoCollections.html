								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									   <div class="page" title="Page 8"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Get your message across by talking to your visitors</strong></span></p><p>Most damage to collections on display is unintentional and occurs because the public are unaware of the dangers that inappropriate handling poses. Education and public relations are powerful tools for making the public aware of the damage that can result from inappropriate handling.</p><p>Most museums, galleries and libraries have attendants, custodians or volunteers who open up the museum, greet visitors, take admission fees and provide information. These people are also in the perfect position to provide information about care of the collections.</p><p>To be effective, this information must give the reasons for your rules in a positive manner which does not belittle or alienate the visitor. This is particularly important with school groups, who are often judged to be guilty before they enter the museum.</p><p>Your attendants could weave the following message into their greeting or introduction to the museum, gallery or library:</p><p>We ask you not to touch the objects on display because, even if you have just washed your hands, you naturally have oils, acids and salts in your skin which will attack the surface of the objects you touch. Please help us take care of our collections!</p><p>It is also important to point out that museums intend their collections to last for many generations.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Get your message across using signs and display labels</p><p>When it is not possible to greet all visitors, signage becomes very important in raising visitor awareness of the problems involved in touching objects. The signs should be positive rather than negative, and educative rather than threatening. ‘Keep off the grass!’ types of signs tend to be counterproductive.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Even if you have just washed your hands you naturally have oils, acids and salts in your skin that will damage the surface of the objects or artefacts that you touch.</strong></span></p><p>An increasing number of visitors to museums in Australia do not speak English or are from a non- English speaking background. It is important to consider translating your signs so that all visitors are aware of your concern to preserve your collection. You can discover, through surveys or through local tourism associations, which countries your tourist visitors come from, and then develop bilingual or multilingual signage explaining how their behaviour can assist you in caring for your collections. Similarly, if your region or community has significant numbers of non-English speaking residents, translations can provide them with the same information as that provided for all your other visitors. This can lead to a greater sense of ownership and involvement.</p><p>Translations of your signs are important, because to date no accepted international symbol has been developed for indicating a prohibition on touching objects in museums, galleries and libraries. There are commercial translating services in most metropolitan areas or, if you are affiliated with the government, you may be eligible to use the Commonwealth Department of Immigration’s translating and interpreting service. Check your telephone directory for contact numbers for the appropriate service near you. Be aware that even the Commonwealth’s service charges for translations.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Let people know what can be touched safely and what cannot</strong></span></p><p>If you want to include a hands-on display in your museum, gallery or library, it is important to distinguish clearly—through signage and display techniques—which items can be touched and which cannot.</p><div class="page" title="Page 9"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Items which can be touched could be marked with appropriate signage, perhaps featuring hands or ‘touch me’ symbols. These objects should be easily accessible to touching, in clear contrast to the rest of the display.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use your display furniture to protect vulnerable items</strong></span></p><p>Even with the best educational and public relations strategies, it is still essential to develop displays which discourage the over-curious from touching objects, and which provide some protection against malicious or criminal damage. There are different ways of achieving this. Most involve keeping the collections at arm’s length.</p><p>Display cases and cabinets are an ideal way of showing valuable or vulnerable objects. Not only are the objects protected from inappropriate handling and casual theft, but they are also protected from environmental hazards, especially dust.</p><p>Unfortunately display cases are usually expensive; and regional and community museums have often been dependent on hand-me-down cases from major museums and government offices. These are better than nothing, but if they are not all of one design, your exhibitions can lack a sense of unity.</p><p>Funding for major items, such as sets of display cases, can sometimes be provided through local service clubs or through government grants.<br> One advantage of sponsorship is that the finished product can look very attractive and a sponsor may be proud to have his or her name associated with the product. Remember also that you may have the expertise within your local or regional community to make display cases to suit your needs. It is not always necessary to buy display furniture from the major cities.</p><p>Contact your State or Territory regional museum programs for advice about various sources of funding, as well as for help writing applications for funding. They may also be able to help you locate display furniture no longer required by the State museums and art galleries, furniture which you can then acquire.</p><div class="page" title="Page 10"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Plinths and barriers are much cheaper and easier to make than display cases. They offer less protection than display cases, but they can offer protection to objects not easily displayed in cases.</p><p>Plinths, barriers and demarcation lines—often tape on the floor—come in a variety of designs; but care must be taken to ensure that they do not become a hazard, particularly if the display area is already congested. Plinths are low, raised bases which surround a display stand. They can be a particular problem for people with impaired vision or bifocals, who may misjudge where the plinth is or be unaware of it and trip and fall into the display. This could cause injury to someone and result in a public liability claim, as well as damage to the collection. Consideration of traffic flow and the placement of items away from narrow or high traffic areas, is important when planning displays.</p><p>If you use plinths in your exhibition, be aware of the items you display near the plinth. If you hang small items or display labels which require close scrutiny near or behind the plinths, people will be tempted to move too close. This will make it more likely that the plinth will be knocked, damaging the object being displayed.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use display design and layout to protect collections</strong></span></p><p>Ramps and walkways are an effective way of allowing access to large but fragile or dangerous machines or to sites which can easily be disturbed. Ramps and walkways may seem ambitious, but are not necessarily expensive and can be constructed by local contractors.</p></div><div class="column"><p>The placement of objects in exhibitions can also be used to protect them. Large objects which do not require close scrutiny can be placed out of reach of the public. This may mean that the objects are hung high on the wall, or are placed behind smaller items that do not obscure them but block access to them.</p><p>Ensure that these objects and their labels can be read properly and that the objects are not forgotten when it comes to cleaning and conservation.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Use security equipment to warn you that items are at risk</strong></span></p><p>Electronic security beams are a relatively cheap method of providing some security against people touching objects. These, usually infrared, are available commercially, and sound an alarm when someone moves too close to the object and breaks the beam.</p><p>Care must be taken to ensure that the beam is not too easily broken, because numerous false alarms cause frustration and embarrassment, and can lead to a real threat being ignored.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>   								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									   <div class="page" title="Page 10"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Encouraging public access to collections inevitably involves some risk of theft to some parts of those collections. Thefts are generally of two types: the planned break-in, in which works are stolen and generally sold; and the impulse theft by a visitor.</p><div class="page" title="Page 11"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Preventive action</strong></span></p><p>While the likelihood of a planned break-in can be reduced through properly securing the building, the chance of an impulse theft by a visitor can be minimised by carefully considered display techniques and visitor procedures.</p><p>No objects should be displayed unsecured.</p><p>If it is not possible to have objects in lockable display cases, then they should be secured to the display with clamps or armatures. Care must be taken to ensure that such devices do not damage the object itself. Perspex clamps and armatures are effective because they are relatively soft and non- reactive, and do not intrude aesthetically.</p><p>It is common museum practice to ask visitors to cloak all bags bigger than a normal handbag, and all heavy coats or bulky objects. This is partly for the visitor’s convenience, but also minimises the risk of accidental damage or theft.</p><p>Framed works are harder to steal if the frames are screwed to the walls rather than hung on nails or brackets. Mirror plates can be screwed to the backs of frames with the extended part of the plate screwed to the wall and painted the same colour as the wall.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>   								</div>

								<h4 class="dslc-tabs-nav-hook">    Vandalism    </h4>
								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									 <div class="page" title="Page 11"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Vandalism is an ever-present threat to the preservation of collections. Whatever the motivation, the damage to the collection is the same.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Preventive action</strong></span></p><p>Assess the risks. It is important to assess the probability of vandalism. You do not want to turn your museum, gallery or library into a fort needlessly, nor do you want to be caught unawares.</p><p>If you are mounting an exhibition which is potentially controversial, you can expect a reaction. However, if you use signs and labels to explain the point of the exhibition, you may diffuse some of the problems. You should also take steps to protect objects which may be at risk. Remember that issues can become controversial suddenly, so an object that was not considered at risk when first displayed may become at risk.</p></div><div class="column"><p>In some cases, you could be displaying items which are culturally sensitive, for example, sacred objects and some indigenous art. It is important to respect these cultural differences. These objects should be removed from display and treated according to the custom of the people who produced the objects.</p><p>Damage to objects generally requires an implement. If the Vatican attendants had demanded that Lazlo Toth place his hammer in the cloakroom, he would have had difficulty smashing Michelangelo’s Pieta.</p><p>Outdoor exhibits, sculpture and graves are very much at risk from graffiti or malicious damage which is at times politically motivated. Such vandalism is very difficult to combat, though strategic placement of lighting can reduce the risk of vandalism.</p><p>If riotous behaviour is known to occur in the local community, again, assessment of when potential trouble may occur should be made and procedures adopted to counteract this danger.</p><p>Secure the building. If there is a possibility that rioting may occur in the local community, the museum should be made secure not just against burglary but against mass break-in. This may require bars or arc mesh over all windows and doors. Although not aesthetically pleasing, such precautions may prevent the destruction of irreplaceable elements of the collection.</p></div></div></div></div> 								</div>
