								<h4 class="dslc-tabs-nav-hook">      Introduction      </h4>
								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									      <p>This section is essentially about the examination of collections, of the individual items in collections and/or the environments in which collections or items are kept. Examining items to determine their condition is an extremely important part of collection management.</p><p>There are two commonly used examination procedures are collection surveys and condition reports.</p><p>Collection surveys serve as a snapshot of the collection, or part of the collection, at a particular time. The level of detail of surveys will vary according to what you wish to know. The information gained can be extremely useful for planning for the future; and it should give you a very clear picture of the extent of the problems you face in maintaining and managing your collection. Knowing the extent of the problem and setting up a program of action to deal with it is far better than being taken by surprise.</p><p>Condition reports can be used as part of the survey process, if you are looking at individual items in detail. They are also prepared before conservation treatments, and are commonly used for travelling exhibitions and for loans. Before an item leaves your museum, gallery or library for a travelling exhibition or on loan, you should document its condition. If the item is going to a number of venues, it is wise to have condition reporting documents that travel with it. These forms should be filled out on arrival at and departure from each venue. If a work is damaged, these forms will help in determining what damage occurred, how the damage occurred, and how to prevent the problem recurring. They can also assist in insurance claims.</p>      								</div>

It may be that you decide not to acquire an item if its poor condition will make it a liability.</p><p>A good time to examine items and record their condition is when they are being accessioned. This way you have a record of their condition from the beginning and can compare this with future condition reports.</p><p>Surveys are also a fundamental part of developing a conservation plan for your collections. Conservation plans provide museums, galleries and libraries with a framework for managing the preservation and conservation of their collections. Collection surveys identify the conservation needs of the collections and can also identify any problems with storage and display environments.</p><p>Before you examine any items, decide on the information you want to know and the amount of detail you will find helpful. Planning will allow you to record relevant information, and reduce the risk of overlooking important points. It will also help you decide whether you want to examine every item or a representative sample of the collection.</p><p>The method of recording the information is equally important. Information resulting from the examination should be readily accessible for it to be of maximum use.</p><p>Planning ahead and preparing a suitable space for the examination will reduce the risk of damage. Don’t examine items on cluttered desks or where there is constant activity—this is courting disaster.</p><p>Examination of collections can involve taking items off display; and it is therefore important to plan the timing of this activity, so that it doesn’t coincide with peak visitor period and does happen when your most experienced staff and volunteers are available.</p><div class="page" title="Page 42"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It is vital that during the examination of objects they are handled correctly and supported adequately, so that they are not damaged.</p><div class="page" title="Page 42"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>For more information</p><p>For more information on the correct handling of objects, please see <a href="./cleanHandling.html">Handling, Transportation, Storage and Display</a>.</p><div class="page" title="Page 42"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><strong>Examination—getting ready</strong></p><p>Proper preparation for the examination can make things much easier and allow you to be more efficient.

Sometimes such damage is not clearly visible until the object is examined with transmitted light.</li></ul><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1075" src="./Collection Surveys and Condition Reporting _ reCollections_files/31b-raking-light-RColl.jpg" alt="31b---raking-light---RColl" width="539" height="400"></p><p>Other diagnostic tools and techniques are available; however, they require specialist equipment, and many require specialist knowledge to interpret the results.</p><p><strong>What to record</strong></p><p><strong>Type of item</strong></p><div class="page" title="Page 43"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>This could be:</p><ul><li>watercolour on paper</li><li>19th century dress</li><li>wooden mask with feathers</li><li>plough</li><li>oil painting on canvas</li><li>leather harness</li><li>photograph</li><li>certificate</li><li>ceramic bowl</li><li>book</li><li>sword</li><li>lace tablecloth</li><li>cutlery</li><li>bark painting</li><li>acrylic painting on door</li><li>Bakelite radiogram</li><li>ivory miniature glass jug</li></ul><p><strong>Item details</strong></p><ul><li><p>title of object, if any;</p></li><li><p>name of artist, manufacturer, author;</p></li><li><p>provenance, if known; and</p></li><li><p>date and place of manufacture.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p><p>These should be recorded in millimetres. For example, an A4 piece of paper is 297 mm x 210 mm. The convention is that height is recorded first.</p><p>The dimensions of three-dimensional objects are recorded in the order of height, width and depth.</p><p>For recording the dimensions of irregularly shaped objects, agree within the examining group on what dimensions you will record. For example, for a teapot you might record height, circumference, and distance from the tip of spout to the furthest point of the handle.</p><div class="page" title="Page 44"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>For flat-image items, further descriptive conventions can be useful.

The sections in this package on the care of different types of objects will provide you with more terms for description of damage, as well as photographs of some typical types of damage.</p><p>Remember to use simple straightforward language in all reporting. Other people who use the reports in future may not have the same technical knowledge that you have.</p><p>Terms such as good, fair, reasonable, poor are often used in condition reporting, but can create problems. What is poor to one person may be fair to another. If you use these general terms, try always to qualify them with a more detailed description of the object.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>      								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									      <div class="column">Collection surveys have the potential to provide an enormous amount of information vital to planning the management of your collection. But to be truly effective, surveys require proper planning. They take time, and require a good set-up for the safe examination of the objects. Before commencing a survey, think about what you want to find out. This will determine the level of detail and the scope of the survey. Do you want to know:</div><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><ul><li>how your storage and display environment compares to recommended levels;</li><li>the details of the condition of all items in your collection;</li><li>the details of the condition of one class of objects within your collection;</li><li>the details of the condition of a sample of one class of objects in the collection;</li><li>what you have in the collection;</li><li>how many of each class of item you have in the collection;</li><li>which items within the collection are priorities for treatment;</li><li>what storage needs upgrading;</li><li>whether the building is sound or if it needs maintenance;</li><li>what sections of the display need upgrading; or</li><li>priorities for salvage in a flood or fire?</li></ul>Or do you just want a general overview of the condition of the whole collection? Once you have established the level of detail and the scope of the survey, you will have an idea of the extent to which it will disrupt normal operations. You will then be able to decide when and how to carry it out, and where to set up the examination area, if one is needed. Allow time for reporting after all examinations are complete. A survey is most effective if the</div><div class="column">findings are used as a basis for planning. They may be used in the collection management plan, the building maintenance plan, the museum, gallery or library improvement plan, in a disaster response, a risk management plan, or in developing a conservation plan. In view of this, a survey is really not complete until the findings have been written up, conclusions drawn and recommendations put forward. Most importantly, use the information, don’t just file it away. <strong>Survey forms</strong> There are no predefined rules for carrying out a survey correctly. You are better off setting up your own structure. Once you have decided what information you want to gather, design a form to record that information. Using such a form, you are less likely to forget some of the details you have to record for each object. The form on the right is provided as a guide only. It was designed by Helen Halley, a paper conservator at Artlab Australia, for a very specific purpose: a survey of the condition and previous treatment of works of art on paper owned by Carrick Hill in South Australia. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1077 size-large" src="./Collection Surveys and Condition Reporting _ reCollections_files/33-paper-works-summary-sheet-RColl-717x1024.jpg" alt="33---paper-works-summary-sheet---RColl" width="717" height="1024"></div>      								</div>

They need to be clear and concise. They may be the result of a collection survey.</p><p><br>They are most often produced as documentation to accompany travelling exhibitions or loan items. If items are going to several venues, it is wise to have condition reporting documents that travel with them, filled out at each arrival and departure point.
