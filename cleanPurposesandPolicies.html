									    <div class="page" title="Page 12"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The most important working document in your organisation is your mission statement. This sets out the broad aims of the museum, gallery or library. All organisations need a clear identity, with stated aims understood by the membership and by those who work for the organisation, whether in paid or unpaid roles.</p><p>For an incorporated body, this statement of purpose is usually expressed in its Articles of Association. For a municipal museum, the local government authority’s corporate plan will generally encompass it in terms of the organisational structure within which the museum operates.</p><p>A statement of purpose (also known as a mission statement) describes the reasons for having a museum in terms of who it is there to serve, and how it will do it. Ideally, this mission statement should be only one or two sentences. All policy development flows from this statement, and it should be the point of reference against which any policy decision is measured.</p><p>The following example of a mission statement was reproduced from the publication What’s in your museum? a handbook on museum registration methods for local museums (3rd edition), compiled by the History Trust of South Australia and published by the University of Canberra.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The aim of the Axel Stenross Maritime Museum is to develop the existing residence and workshop of the late Axel Alfred Stenross into a Maritime Museum; foster active interest in the preservation of the tools, workshops and other relics formerly owned by the late Axel Alfred Stenross; and generally foster a public interest in the maritime history of the Port Lincoln area.</em></p></div></div></div></div>    								</div>

While in reality this may</p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The result of not having a collection management policy!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 13"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>not be achieved, museums are certainly expected to last longer than a single human lifetime. For a museum to continue long after we are gone, guidelines—commonly known as policies—must be developed.</p><p>Policies stem directly from mission statements and are developed to provide long-term frameworks for decision-making. They exist at all levels. National policies like the National Conservation and Preservation Policy for Movable Cultural Heritage help set the agenda for thinking about issues in conservation. Organisational policies set the agenda for the operations of your museum, gallery or library.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Uses for policies</strong></span></p><p>Written policies have practical purposes in museums. They clarify the museum’s views on issues, and can be referred to when decisions on those issues have to be made. This makes the operation of the museum easier, and makes decisions more consistent. Written policies make it easier to convince outside bodies that you have thought about your goals, and know where you are headed. This can be useful when applying for assistance, dealing with local councils, or meeting with industry.</p><p>In addition, every object your museum, gallery or library acquires has associated costs. In order to manage both the cost and the object, you must have a clear idea of why you want an item; whether it is important enough to obtain; what you will do with it after you acquire it; and the implications of handling and storing the item in terms of your funds, resources and time. Policies which clarify these issues can help you manage and contain your costs.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A collections policy</strong></span></p><p>Many different aspects of museums, galleries and libraries can be covered by policies. Large organisations may have separate policies to cover such issues as: acquisitions, research, sponsorship, education, volunteers, cultural diversity, interpretation and exhibitions; collection management and conservation; and access to or the return of indigenous material, secret or sacred objects and/or human remains. Smaller organisations often develop a single document which incorporates the fundamental policies of the museum or gallery. This document is referred to a ‘collections policy’.</p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Collections policies include:</strong></span></p><ul><li>a mission statement setting out the purpose of the museum or gallery;</li><li>an acquisition policy stating what the museum intends to collect, and defining the scope of the collection, how the material will be used, and the criteria for determining significance when acquiring material; and</li><li>a collection management policy setting out the principles of how the museum will manage what it acquires, addressing all the issues relating to the care and maintenance of the collection, including guidelines for dealing with documentation, loans, conservation and care, storage and security, and deaccession and disposal.</li></ul><p>These elements are the core of a collections policy; however, individual policies may include other types of material. These can be policy statements on special issues of importance, or references to other documents such as disaster plans, insurance policies or procedure manuals. Often policies include definitions of terms used in the document, or the reason why a policy is needed on an issue. In some areas in Australia, the term ‘collection management policy’ is used to encompass all these policy elements.</p></div></div></div></div>    								</div>

									    <div class="page" title="Page 13"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Policy statements set out the broad framework for development. They do not spell out the processes used to achieve the development. This is the task of procedures.</p><p>Procedures are step-by-step instructions on how to perform specific tasks. They are guided by policies, and are the result of implementing policies and plans. Written procedures document what is actually done in an area. They take time to write down; and this often prevents small museums with limited resources from developing manuals on procedure. However, written procedures introduce a consistency into operating practices and reduce the risk of important steps being overlooked. They are especially useful if a number of staff or volunteers perform the same task. In the long run, they will save time and improve operations.</p><div class="page" title="Page 16"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Procedures are required in any part of a museum, gallery or library where tasks are repeated regularly.
