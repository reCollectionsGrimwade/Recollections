								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									  <div class="page" title="Page 10"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Handle paper as little as possible because it is highly susceptible to physical damage such as creasing and tearing. When you have to handle paper, make sure your hands are clean. Wearing gloves provides added protection. Cotton gloves are often recommended, but they are not always appropriate because they can make it much harder to pick up individual sheets of paper. Clean, close-fitting, surgical gloves are a good alternative to cotton gloves.</p><p>Use commonsense when handling fragile paper. Remember that old paper can be very brittle, and all paper is vulnerable to damage. So it is important to provide proper support.</p><p>If you have to pick up paper to examine it closely, it is better to place it on a rigid support, like a piece of cardboard, and lift the board. Holding it in your hand increases the risk of damage.</p><p>If you must carry paper over any distance, it should be carried horizontally on a rigid support, and with a covering material to stop the paper being picked up by the breeze. Sandwiching paper between two pieces of acid-free board will protect it well.</p><p>Even if your documents or works of art are mounted already, don’t tuck them under your arm to carry them. They should be supported as described above.</p><p>Placing them in folders, Mylar pockets, Copysafe sleeves or polyethylene bags provides extra protection—with the exception of pastels and chalks, (see below).</p><p>Remember, the safest way to carry prints, drawings, watercolours and documents over long distances is in specially designed portfolios or Solander boxes.</p><p>If you’re handling more than one paper item, separate each one with a sheet of tissue paper or good-quality paper—preferably acid-free.</p><p>If chalks, pastels, watercolours or pencil are abraded or smudged, the damage is permanent. Never allow rough paper or board to come into contact with these media. Do not place plastics such as Mylar, polyethylene or Perspex near chalks or pastels as the static attracts the loosely bound pigment. Don’t allow anything to rub them. It is best not to stack these types of works.</p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Never allow newsprint, wrapping paper or any printed matter to come into contact with prints, drawings, watercolours or documents. The inks may off-set onto your valued object.</p><p>Remember that mounts on works are visible when the works are on display, so take steps to avoid soiling the mounts. Direct handling of mounts can lead to soiling, so it is advisable to wear clean, cotton gloves when handling mounted works.</p><p>Don’t mend paper using self-adhesive ‘sticky’ tapes of any kind. These tapes go through a number of stages when they deteriorate:</p><ul><li>firstly, the adhesive becomes very sticky and will be easily absorbed into the paper; and</li><li>in the next stage, the adhesive changes chemically and begins to yellow and eventually turns a dark orange. At this stage the adhesive is almost totally insoluble and, therefore, the stains cannot be removed.</li></ul><p>Never use rubber cement or wood glue with works on paper. These adhesives can discolour badly as they age.</p><p>Large works which require two people to carry them should be placed between two pieces of mount board. The route to be followed should be cleared of obstacles; and if there are doors that need to be opened, make sure there is a third person available to open them.</p><p>Don’t use ink or markers near works on paper and documents—use pencil only.</p><p>Paper clips, even plastic ones, can damage fragile paper. Avoid them.</p><p>Rolled plans and works on paper should not be secured with rubber bands, because these will perish over time. Use cotton tape.</p><p>If you are rolling large paper items, roll them onto a tube to support them—rather than placing them inside the tube—this way you avoid damage by creasing.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about caring for paper, please see the chapter on <a href="./cleanPaper.html">Paper</a> in Cultural Material.</span></p></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									  <div class="page" title="Page 11"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>When removing a book from the shelf don’t pull it by the top of the spine, because you can cause a great deal of damage this way. Pulling a book from a shelf by the top of the spine will eventually break the spine at the joint. This can lead to the joint splitting along the full length of the spine.</p><p>The correct way to take a book from a shelf is to push the books on either side of it further into the shelf and hold the book firmly with your hand around the spine and your fingers on one cover and your thumb on the other.</p><p>For this reason, it is wise to leave some space between your books and the back of the shelf when you first set them up on a shelf.</p><p>When you have to handle books, make sure your hands are clean, otherwise you can leave dirty marks on the bindings and the pages. You can wear gloves for added protection—cotton gloves are often recommended, but they are not always appropriate because they can make it much harder to turn the pages. Close-fitting surgical gloves are a good alternative to cotton gloves. But cotton gloves should be worn when handling books with gold leaf decorations on the covers or on the foredge of the textblock.</p><p>Books should be opened gently: the spine and the sewing can be broken if the book is forced open. If you’re using a book which cannot open flat, give it some support so that you don’t strain its structure.</p><p>When opening new or newly bound books, don’t open them from the centre. Start from the front and then the back, and open them gradually, section by section, until you reach the middle. This gradually eases them open and flexes the new structure gently. Opening them at the middle and forcing them to open flat can break the structure.</p><p>It is always best to turn pages slowly and with care. It is very easy to tear the paper if you are flicking through the pages quickly.</p><p>Don’t lick your fingers to turn the pages: the moisture can set dirt into the paper. You can also transfer dirt and germs from the paper to your mouth. If the book has been fumigated against insects or mould, you may be putting yourself at risk.</p></div><div class="column"><p>If you are carrying valuable books, put them in a sturdy box. Don’t try to carry lots of books at once. You could hurt yourself, and if you drop the books you will damage them.</p><p>The covers of books can be severely disfigured by abrasion and scratching. This is especially noticeable with very smooth, calf-leather bindings. Don’t stack valuable or delicate books, or carry them in such a way that they will rub against each other.</p><p>If books do get damaged, be aware that some repairs can cause further damage. For this reason it is recommended that you do not use sticky tapes of any kind.</p><p>These tapes go through a number of stages when they deteriorate. Firstly, the adhesive becomes very sticky and will be easily absorbed into paper, bookcloths and leather. In the next stage, the adhesive changes chemically and begins to yellow and eventually turns a dark orange. At this stage, the adhesive is almost totally insoluble and, therefore, the stains cannot be removed. Once the adhesive become insoluble, the tape usually falls away: so the repair has failed and you still have the damage. In addition to the original damage, the paper is now badly stained as well.</p><p>Paper clips, even plastic ones, can damage and distort paper. They should not be used for attaching labels or marking your place. Metal paper clips rust over time and stain paper.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information on caring for books, please see the chapter on <a href="./cleanBooks.html">Books</a> in Cultural Materials.</span></p></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

Accidents are more likely if one person tries to do everything.</p><p>Trolleys should be padded to prevent damage to frames.</p><p>If any damage does occur during the move, carefully collect and save any pieces, no matter how small— even tiny paint flakes—and document the damage.</p><p>Glazed artworks should be carried with care. Acrylic glazing such as Perspex is easily scratched, and glass can break if dropped or knocked.</p><p>If you are transporting paintings which are glazed with glass, tape the glass with masking tape. This will hold the pieces of glass together if it breaks, reducing the risk of damage to the work.</p><p>Make sure that you put tape on the glass only. If it gets onto the frame it can damage paint or finishes when it is removed.</p><p>For small frames, one strip of tape vertically in the centre of the glass, one horizontal strip and one strip on each diagonal will be sufficient. Larger frames will need more.</p><p>If you fold the tape back on itself at one end of each strip, it will be easier to remove. Remove the tape as soon as possible after the move. Pull the tape off at a very low angle and pull gently.</p><p>There is no need to tape Perspex or Plexiglas, and the tape can be difficult to remove—so don’t tape these glazing materials.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

									  <div class="page" title="Page 13"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Unstretched paintings can be difficult to handle. If they are allowed to flop or move too much, the paint can begin to come away from the surface of the canvas. It is very important that unstretched paintings are well supported.</p><p>If the paintings are small enough to be moved flat, put a rigid support under them so that they can be handled easily without flopping and distorting. A sheet of Foam-Cor or a strong mount board would be suitable.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 14"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Larger unstretched paintings may need to be rolled to be carried.</p><p>The roller should be as large in diameter as possible, preferably at least 200mm. The larger the painting, the larger the diameter of the roller should be.</p><p>Rollers can be specially made of light-weight materials, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Ribloc—ask the manufacturer to make the roller with the ribs on the inside, if possible;</p></li><li><p>PVC pipe, a 300mm diameter pipe is a good size for most works.</p></li></ul><p>Rollers should be covered with a layer of padding, either polyethylene foam, such as Plastazote, or Dacron wadding covered with clean, white, cotton fabric, to compensate for any irregularities in the painting’s thickness.</p><p>It is very important that paintings are rolled the right way, painted-side out, and that they are properly interleaved and the roller properly padded. If the paint layer is on the inside when the painting is rolled, the paint will become compressed and will develop creases that will remain in the painting after it has been unrolled.</p><p>It is best to roll the painting with an interleaving layer of Tyvek to prevent any transfer of pigment. The Tyvek should be larger in length and width than the painting.</p><p>When rolled, the painting should be tied firmly, but not tightly, with cotton tape in several places along the roll.</p><p>If more than one painting is to be rolled on a roller, the paintings should be laid out flat and interleaved with Protecta Foam, as for flat storage. Once this is done, the paintings should be rolled onto the roller all at the same time. Remember, all the paintings should be painted-side out.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about caring for paintings, please refer see the chapter on <a href="./cleanPaintings.html">Paintings</a> in Cultural Material.</span></p></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

									  <div class="page" title="Page 15"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The most important rule for handling textiles is: do not handle textiles unless you must. Always keep handling to a minimum.</p><p>Whenever possible wear clean, cotton gloves when handling textiles. Sometimes this is not practical, so make sure your hands are clean. Always wash them before handling a textile. This will prevent the transfer of body-oil and dirt to the textiles.</p><p>Keeping your hands clean is particularly important with textiles incorporating metal thread, because the metal will tarnish in reaction to acids from the skin.</p><p>It is important to remove jewellery such as rings, bracelets and necklaces when handling textiles. They might catch on the textiles and pull threads or tear the textiles.</p><p>When you do handle textiles, they should always be properly supported. Textiles that appear strong may, in fact, have areas of weakness which are not immediately visible. As a rule, all historic textiles should be regarded as fragile.</p><p>When handling flat textiles:</p><ul><li><p>never pick them up by one corner. Always support the weight of the textile evenly;</p></li><li><p>small textiles should be carried either on a tray, in a box or on a board;</p></li><li><p>larger textiles should be rolled, and carried on the roller. Hold onto the part of the roller extending beyond the textile; and</p></li><li><p>never try to move a textile by yourself, if the size and weight of the textile indicate that you need two people. Carrying large textiles incorrectly can damage them, and the person carrying them could be injured.</p></li></ul><p>When handling costumes, remember:</p><ul><li><p>costumes should never be picked up by the shoulders;</p></li><li><p>always slide your arms under the costume and then lift;</p></li><li><p>ideally costumes should be moved in boxes or on a board; and</p></li><li><p>don’t carry items on a hanger without using your arms for additional support.</p></li></ul></div><div class="column"><p>When handling accessories:</p><p>generally accessories should be transported on boards or in boxes. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Use your commonsense to decide the most appropriate way to handle them; and remember, accessories should always be evenly supported.
