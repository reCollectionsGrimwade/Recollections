The extent to which large city museums, galleries and libraries involve volunteers varies from place to place, although the majority of staff are likely to be paid workers. Both large and small organisations frequently include volunteers on their boards and committees.</p><p>While no definitive across-the-board survey has been conducted, indications are that many of the volunteers are women in the older age-bracket. However, this profile does appear to be changing, with more men and young people becoming involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Attitudes to volunteering</strong></span></p><p>Volunteering is, of course, not new. What is new is:</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 41"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li><p>increased attention to the concept and practice of volunteering;</p></li><li><p>recognition of the contribution of volunteers;</p></li><li><p>acknowledgment of the advantages of developing joint partnerships between paid and voluntary workers;</p></li><li><p>the fact that volunteers are generally more selective about where they volunteer and what they do, so that their own interests are being met while doing something worthwhile;</p></li><li><p>an acceptance of the fact that effective management is essential if the knowledge, skills and experience of volunteers are to be put to the best use; and</p></li><li><p>some museums and galleries do not discriminate between paid and non-paid staff and refer to all staff as workers.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Benefits of volunteer involvement</strong></span></p><p>Volunteer involvement benefits an organisation as it:</p><ul><li><p>encourages community participation;</p></li><li><p>initiates, enhances and extends services; and</p></li><li><p>provides a cost-effective service.</p></li></ul></div><div class="column"><p>Benefits for the individual volunteer include opportunities to:</p><ul><li><p>get with the action and become involved in new areas;</p></li><li><p>advocate change and seek more say in decisions;</p></li><li><p>improve and extend services;</p></li><li><p>pursue a long-term or new interest;</p></li><li><p>maintain existing skills or develop new skills; and</p></li><li><p>increase social contacts.</p></li></ul><p>Effective volunteer management brings benefit to:</p><ul><li><p>the project;</p></li><li><p>the organisation, including the paid workers;</p></li><li><p>the volunteer; and</p></li><li><p>the community at large.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dangers of volunteer involvement</strong></span></p><ul><li><p>Whatever the activity, exploitation can occur.

Not only are paid workers in danger of losing their jobs, volunteers may be expected to perform tasks and roles which they do not choose to do and which have been deemed to be the province of paid workers.</p><p>The risk of conflict between paid and voluntary workers increases when volunteers are thought of as angels and paid workers are thought of as interested only in the wage package.</p><div class="page" title="Page 42"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Costs of volunteer involvement</strong></span></p><p>Volunteer involvement is not free.

									    <p>Before recruitment begins, thought should be given to the profile of the volunteer team. Are you seeking a cross-section of ages and backgrounds, and both male and female volunteers, so that the team is representative of the general community; or is this immaterial?</p><p>Clear job descriptions must be in place before recruitment begins. Each job description should include the overall job as well as detailed tasks, for example, a receptionist who will greet visitors, answer queries made personally and by phone, and operate the word processor. The person to whom the volunteer will be responsible should also be named.</p><p>Thought should also be given to:</p><ul><li>required skills, current or to be acquired;</li><li>personal attributes; and</li><li>time commitments.</li></ul><p>Potential volunteers should be informed of:</p><ul><li>the organisation’s expectations of them, for example, attendance at a training course for museum guides; and</li><li>what the volunteer can expect from the organisation, for example, out-of-pocket expenses and insurance cover.</li></ul><p>As in the case of paid staff, haphazard selection will assist neither the organisation nor the person recruited.</p><div class="page" title="Page 44"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Successful selection involves matching both:</p><ul><li>the volunteer’s skills, attributes and time availability with the job description; and</li><li>the needs and expectations of the volunteer with the needs and expectations of the organisation.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Orientation</strong></span></p><p>If recruitment and selection procedures have been well devised, orientation will have begun before the volunteers begin work. New volunteer staff will know and accept the purpose of the organisation and the job expected of them. After recruitment, they will want further details about the organisation: about the management and service personnel, organisational structures and further details of their particular job.</p><p>Areas which could be included during orientation are:</p><ul><li>introductory reading material about the organisation;</li><li>a tour of the organisation, its services, programs and facilities;</li><li>an introduction to staff—paid and voluntary;</li><li>personnel matters;</li><li>the organisation’s systems of operation, including communication channels;</li><li>details of the job for which the volunteer has been recruited; and</li><li>occupational health and safety, and evacuation procedures.</li></ul><p>A staff handbook can facilitate the orientation process.

Often volunteers are recruited because they already have the experience and skills to do the job: a retired shipwright could take on the job of refurbishing a sailing vessel, for example. On the other hand, volunteers may not have the necessary skills.<br> The important thing for both the organisation and the volunteer is to ensure volunteers are prepared, so that they can adequately perform their work.</p><p>Remember that there are many ways of learning and of training people. Look to options such as a buddy system, mentoring, modelling good practice, and guided reading.</p><p>Further training may be necessary if the volunteer wishes to take on additional or different jobs, or the organisation introduces a new program.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>    								</div>

									    <div class="page" title="Page 47"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 1.</strong></span></p><p>Answer: No. If both the organisation and the volunteer are to benefit, then a double match is necessary. An inappropriate match is a liability to the organisation and is likely to destroy the volunteer’s enthusiasm. It may be possible to refer the potential volunteer to an area more in keeping with his or her skills or interests. If the person is obviously not ready to volunteer, for example, recovering from trauma or illness, referral to a social or support service may be appropriate.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 48"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2.</strong></span></p><p>Answer: Possible strategies include:</p><ul><li><p>involving a volunteer and paid staff in the planning, recruitment and selection of new volunteers and in the orientation process;</p></li><li><p>asking a long-serving volunteer to buddy a new volunteer for the first few months;</p></li><li><p>when reviewing progress, involving the whole staff team;</p></li><li><p>seeking perspectives and suggestions from long standing and new volunteers as well as paid staff. </p></li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 3.</strong></span></p><p>Answer: No. The size of the organisation, its function, the make-up of staff—paid and voluntary or entirely voluntary—its location and geographical spread will all have an influence on the manner in which the program is managed. However, every program needs to establish its goals, as well as structures and strategies, to achieve those goals.</p></div></div></div></div>								</div>
