For this reason, we don’t always realise just how fragile they are and so don’t always give them the care that they need.

Some people feel that garments can’t be fully appreciated unless they are worn. This is understandable; but the preservation of historic costume demands that the temptation to wear the costume be resisted.</p><p>A fabric may appear strong; but when it is strained, even slightly, it can tear or the seam stitching can break. This damage is increased when the garment isn’t a good fit on the person wearing it—or if the person does not have the correct undergarments to support the costume. Remember, body shapes have changed and modern undergarments do not necessarily give the right body shape for historical costumes.</p><p>The actions of dressing and undressing can cause a lot of damage to fragile items.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Sitting down or raising your arms in a fragile costume could result in irreparable damage.</p><p>Body oils can transfer from the skin to the garment. This can cause disfiguring stains, and the soiling can attract insects.</p><p>Food and drink could be spilt on the garment, resulting in unsightly staining. The chemicals in food and drink could also react adversely with the textile itself, or with the dyes in the textile.</p><p>The way women move has changed. For example, some dresses were designed so that women could not raise their arms without damaging the dress.</p><p>The stress and strain caused by wearing a garment can be immediate and dramatic, or it can contribute to the gradual weakening of the item. Even seemingly minor damage can ruin an historic costume. So it is best to avoid wearing historic costumes from your collection.</p></div></div></div>                                                 								</div>

The effects are not always dramatically obvious. Changes occur gradually over a long period of time. However, once the changes have occurred they are often irreversible, or require complex and costly treatment to deal with them.</p><p>A good storage environment prevents physical damage and helps to slow down chemical deterioration, greatly increasing the life of your textile items.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ideal storage conditions for textiles</strong></span></p><p>Textiles are considered to be sensitive materials; that is, they are extremely vulnerable to damage when stored or displayed in inappropriate environmental conditions.</p><p>Ideally, textiles should be stored in an environment where the temperature is constant and moderate: in the range 18–22oC.</p><p>Relative humidity should be constant and in the range of 45–55%. This can be very difficult in extreme climates. If it is not possible to keep the relative humidity within these limits, it is important to avoid rapid fluctuations in relative humidity.</p><p>Light should be kept to a minimum. Light is required only when the textiles have to be viewed, for example, when they are being accessioned, treated, or used for research. Information about appropriate lighting levels is given in the section Ideal Conditions for Displaying Textiles.</p><p>Protect textiles from pollutants, dust and insects.</p><p>Airborne chemicals that most commonly affect textiles include smoke, oil and acids. Smoke causes staining and discolouration, which are extremely difficult to remove. Textiles displayed in a room with a fireplace or where smoking is permitted should be housed in smoke-proof containers such as sealed frames or sealable boxes.</p><p>Acids are also given off in small quantities by pest strips and some types of plastic. Consequently, pest strips normally should not be used inside enclosed storage areas.</p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Practical hints for storing flat textiles</strong></span></p></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Small flat textiles can be stored flat, either in a box or on covered shelves. Dust covers should be provided for textiles on open shelves.</p><p>Always interleave textiles with acid-free tissue, if a number of them are stored one on top of the other.</p><p>Take care to not stack too many items on top of each other and place heavier items on the bottom of the stack.</p><p>If a textile needs to be folded, the fold needs to be padded—either with crumpled tissue or with a covered Dacron sausage. This is made from a tube of white or unbleached cotton filled with Dacron. Padding is an important precaution because textiles will eventually split along the line of sharp folds or creases.</p><div class="page" title="Page 11"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Ideally, larger flat textiles should be rolled. When choosing a roller on which to store a flat textile, there are several things to consider.</p><p>The diameter of the roller should be as large as possible—to minimise the curvature of the textile when it is on the roll.</p><p>The roller should be longer than the textile’s width, so that when rolled, the ends of the roll are exposed and the edges of the textile are protected by the projecting ends of the roller.</p><div class="page" title="Page 12"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The roller should be covered with an acid-free material such as acid-free tissue, acid-free paper or Tyvek. This protects the textile from impurities and other damaging chemicals which might be contained in the roller.

You can do this by sandwiching the fringe or tassels between acid-free tissue before you start rolling.</p><div class="page" title="Page 12"><p>To prepare the textile for rolling:</p><ul><li>lay the textile out, face-down onto a clean, flat surface. Make sure that the weave of the textile is straight, and check that the weave of the fabric is not warped;</li><li>cover the textile with a layer of acid-free tissue paper. Check that there are no creases in the tissue: these can cause corresponding creases in the textile, and damage it;</li><li>if the textile has areas of padded decoration or the weave is distorted in any way, it will interfere with the rolling process. A piece of Dacron polyester wadding wrapped in acid-free tissue should be placed over the acid-free tissue in the location of the decoration or distortion. The Dacron must be covered, to prevent any of its fibres transferring to the textile or catching on any surface decoration; and</li><li>if you leave approximately 100mm of tissue protruding beyond your textile, you can use this to start the rolling procedure.</li></ul><p>When you have finished preparing the textile:</p><ul><li>place the covered roller on the protruding end of the tissue and start rolling. Use a firm pressure so that, as the textile is rolled onto the roller, it remains straight and firm.</li><li>the weave should be kept straight while the textile is being rolled;</li><li>once the textile is fully rolled, cover it with another layer of acid-free tissue and/or Tyvek. Secure the cover by tying the ends with cotton tape. It is important to not tie the tape too tightly, because it can distort the edges of the rolled textile;</li><li>very large textiles should also be tied with cotton tape in the centre, to prevent sagging. Again, do not tie the tape too tightly, it might damage the textile; and</li><li>label the textile clearly to identify it in storage.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Preparing historic garments for storage</strong></span></p><p>It is important to ensure that garments are as clean and dry as possible before they are packed away. If the costume is not cleaned, colourless stains may darken with age, and insects such as the clothes moth and carpet beetles will be attracted to organic stains from perspiration and food.</p><p>If the garment is strong, it is advisable to have it dry-cleaned.</p><p>There are some steps you can take to minimise the risks associated with dry-cleaning historic costume:</p><p>Always use a drycleaner who is a member of a professional drycleaner's association.</p><p>Be sure to ask for special care if the item is fragile or complex.</p><p>Prepare your garments carefully for dry-cleaning, by either covering buttons and hooks with Dacron or by removing them from the garment.</p><p>Request that the garment be cleaned on its own.</p><p>Ask the drycleaner to place the costume in a bag in the dry-cleaning machine. This gives it support and prevents it rubbing against other items if it is not on its own.</p><p>It is better to clean historic costume in fresh solvent—so ask the drycleaners when they are next changing their solvents and schedule your work for that time.</p><p>Remember, it is better to leave a garment stained than to damage it greatly during cleaning; so leave fragile items until you have had a chance to seek advice.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Remember that dry-cleaning machines have a vigorous, mechanical action similar to a tumble drier, and so can damage fragile textiles and costumes. Check with a textiles conservator if you are unsure whether the items you are dry-cleaning are strong enough.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An easy, do-it-yourself padded hanger for costumes </strong></span></p><div class="page" title="Page 13"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Apart from very heavy or fragile items, many garments can be stored on padded hangers. Padded hangers are used for hanging costume such as shirts, bodices and dresses. Other items such as trousers or skirts need additional support.

You will need:</li><li>a coat-hanger—it should be strong and made of either wood or plastic. Wire hangers are not suitable. Make sure that the size of the coat-hanger is appropriate for the garment to be hung. For example, don’t use a large coat- hanger for a child's garment.

Sew at least four tapes onto strong areas of the waistband. If four tapes are not enough to fully support the weight of the skirt, use more. Use a fine needle for sewing and sew through all layers of the waistband.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1091" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/16c-padded-coat-RColl.jpg" alt="16c---padded-coat---RColl" width="235" height="400"></p><div class="page" title="Page 14"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Sew tapes only to strong areas of the costume.

The Tyvek will act as a barrier between the box material and your textiles.</p><p>When packing garments in boxes, it is advisable to pad the garments. Crushed, acid-free tissue can be used along all of the folds in the garment and on the side seams, shoulders and sleeves so you will also need enough acid-free tissue paper to pad one average-size garment.</p><p>Remember, creases and folds should be well padded, to minimise stress on the fabric. With time, creases develop into splits if not padded adequately.</p><p>Take care to not put too many textiles in one box, because the weight may crease the lower textiles.

Polyvinyl chloride—PVC—is a commonly available plastic, but avoid using it.</p><p>The following list of good and bad materials—from a preservation viewpoint—can help you in selecting your storage and display furniture, or the materials to use when making them yourself.</p><div class="page" title="Page 17"><table><colgroup><col><col> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>GOOD</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>BAD</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>enamelled metal</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>chipboard, Custom wood</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>acid-free board</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>uncured PVA glue</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>acid-free paper and tissue</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>uncured paint</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>polypropylene</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>protein based glues,for example, animal glue</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>polyester film and felt</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>cellulose nitrate</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Cotton</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>polyurethanes</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>linen</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>unsealed wood, especially hardwoods</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>acrylic paints and varnishes</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>PVC</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>sealed wood</p></div></div></td><td><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>wool, if metal is also present</p></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>                                                 								</div>

You will need:</p><ul><li>white cotton flannelette. This layer acts as an environmental buffer and as padding for the textile. It is advisable to wash the flannelette in hot water before you use it, so that it shrinks. Shrinkage after you use it on the mount board causes distortion of the board;</li><li>a background, support fabric which has a suitable colour, weave and fibre to harmonise with the textile to be mounted. A general rule for selecting backing fabrics is that they should be made of the same fibre as that being mounted. For example, a silk textile should be mounted on a silk fabric. If you can’t use the same fabric, a chemically inert</li><li>polyester fabric should be used. Wool and silk are chemically compatible and can be used together;</li><li>acid-free board, such as acid-free Foam Cor, for the base of the mount;</li><li>a Stanley knife or utility knife and metal rule for cutting out the board;</li><li>PVA glue—acid-free PVA is available and should be used if possible;</li><li>a fine needle—a slightly bent needle or a curved needle will be easier to use;</li><li>thread; pins; and</li><li>scissors.</li></ul></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Cut the acid-free board to the required size— usually the size of the textile to be mounted plus a border. Borders generally have the same dimensions at the top and sides, with a slightly larger allowance at the bottom edge. The extra allowance at the bottom edge makes the item being mounted look centred on the mount. If this allowance is not made, the item will look as though it is too low on the mount. This is called optical centring.</p><div class="page" title="Page 18"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Cover the board with white, cotton flannelette. The fabric should be cut larger than the board, so that it can be folded to the back of the board to be attached firmly.</p><div class="page" title="Page 19"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Pull the flannelette tightly over the board and pin it to the sides of the board. Cut the corners away to allow a flat fold-over.</p><p>Check that the grain of the fabric is straight in both directions before fixing it in place.</p><p>To fix it in place, glue the fold-overs of fabric to the back of the board using a polyvinyl acetate— PVA—adhesive. Pin the fold-overs in place, to hold them while the glue dries. PVA can be used as long as it dries fully and cures before the mounted textile is framed.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1045" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/18d-mount-textiles-RColl.jpg" alt="18d---mount-textiles---RColl" width="529" height="420"></p><div class="page" title="Page 19"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Cut the background support fabric and attach it to the board in the same way as you did with the flannelette. Remember to cut the fabric larger than the board, because it has to overlap on the back of the board.</p><p>Once the glue attaching the background fabric has dried, glue another piece of this fabric in place onto the back of the board over the fold-overs. This gives the back of the board a finished appearance and hides the cut edges of the fold- overs.</p><p>Once the prepared board is completely dry, lay the textile on the front fabric and stitch it into place. Don’t apply tension to the textile when you are stitching it.</p><p>Before stitching, ensure that the grain of the textile is aligned with the grain of the backing fabric, otherwise it can look lopsided.</p><p>Use herringbone stitches on frayed edges—this will help prevent further fraying. A running stitch can be used on hemmed edges or selvages.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1044" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/18c-mount-textiles-RColl.jpg" alt="18c---mount-textiles---RColl" width="518" height="400"></p><div class="page" title="Page 19"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>All edges of the textile should be sewn.

Conservation framing is designed to protect against harmful environmental effects such as light, dust and insect attack.</p><p>Framing your textile using the wrong techniques and materials can cause irreparable damage. Conservation materials and techniques may be more expensive than general framing, but it is really worth the investment. The following notes outline the main points to be considered when framing textiles.</p><p>It is strongly recommended that frames containing textiles be glazed to provide added protection. Glazing provides a barrier at the front of the frame. The barrier buffers the textile against fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature. It keeps insects, dust and pollutant gases away from the textile, and provides some protection against the harmful effects of light and UV radiation.</p><div class="page" title="Page 20"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>The selection of glazing materials is important. Glass can be used, but it does have disadvantages:</p><ul><li>if the glass breaks, it can very easily cut your textile; and</li><li>glass provides only a little protection against the harmful effects of UV radiation.</li></ul><p>Plexiglas 231, an acrylic UV-filtering glazing, is much better than glass. It does not break and it gives added protection against UV radiation.</p><p>The glazing material should not be in direct contact with the textile because:</p><ul><li>this can flatten the texture of the textile through pressure; and</li><li>mould can grow on the item, if environmental changes result in condensation forming on the inside of the glazing.</li></ul><p>A slip, spacer or window mount should be used to separate the glazing from the mounted item.</p><p>The covered, acid-free board on which the textile is mounted should fit into the frame with a couple of millimetres gap in each direction: so that if the board expands, it will not distort.</p><p>An acid-free board should be placed on the back of the frame, to seal the frame from dust and insects. It should be attached firmly to the frame and sealed with tape.</p><p>The correct mounting and framing of textiles not only protects and prolongs their lives, but can also greatly enhance their appearance.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>                       								</div>

It is difficult to get a complete picture of the cut of a garment if it is hanging on a coat-hanger. For this reason, garments are regularly placed on mannequins for display, however, the mannequins used are not always appropriate. A costume needs to be displayed in the correct way: so that it is supported and not vulnerable to physical stress, and so that it communicates accurate information about the fashions and customs of its period. The most important consideration when displaying a costume on a mannequin is to make sure that the mannequin is the right size and shape for the costume. Each costume has a particular silhouette which provides an accurate representation of fashions of a particular period; and this cannot be seen if the mannequin used is the wrong size or shape.</div><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><figure id="attachment_973" style="width: 363px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-973" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/Textiles_Displaying-historic-costumes_1-1.jpg" alt="An unmodified mannequin" width="363" height="500"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> An unmodified mannequin</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>If you do not have a mannequin of the correct size and shape, it is relatively easy to:<ul><li>modify a mannequin to suit a particular garment; and</li><li>provide the correct undergarments for the period.</li></ul><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Modifying an existing mannequin</strong></span></div><div class="column">A mannequin can be modified to suit the garment which you are going to display. If you have a choice, it is best to select a mannequin which is smaller than the garment, and then pad it to fit the garment exactly. If you have a mannequin which is smaller than the garment, begin by measuring the garment in a number of areas, such as the hips, waist, chest, shoulders, shoulders to waist and inside trouser leg. Careful measuring will ensure that you will not need to keep trying the costume on the mannequin while modifying it. This minimises handling of the garment, which is very important, especially if it is fragile.</div><div class="column">Then attach Dacron to the mannequin, to create the correct shape for the garment. The easiest way to do this is to cover the mannequin with a layer of tubular cotton stockinet fabric. The Dacron is placed underneath the Stockinet and held in place by the stretch of the fabric. Tacking stitches in white thread can be used if additional support is required.</div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column">If you have a mannequin which is larger than the costume, the mannequin will need to be reduced in size. Electric sanders and saws are useful for this job. Once the mannequin has been cut down it should be covered as described above. You may have to wrap the mannequin in cotton bandages to smooth over any rough surfaces before padding the mannequin. Contemporary mannequins are generally not suitable for displaying historic costume because they have the wrong silhouette and inappropriate faces.<div class="page" title="Page 23"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column">Undergarments should be made from white or unbleached fabric.

These are cheap and readily available materials that can be used to good effect. The following instructions explain how to make a basic mannequin for a dress. The measurements used in these diagrams are a guide only; you will have to modify them to fit individual garments.</div><div class="column">The basic stand is made of hardwood 25mm in diameter and approximately one metre long. The hardwood is sunk into a round base approximately 300mm in diameter and 40mm deep. The base may be heavier if necessary. All wood surfaces must be sealed with a clear Estapol or the like. This slows the migration of acids from the wood.</div><div class="column"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1048" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/21-mannequin-RColl.jpg" alt="21---mannequin---RColl" width="355" height="300"></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column">Drill 5mm holes through the stand at 10mm intervals. This allows for the waistline of the mannequin to be altered to suit a particular costume. Place a steel pin through the holes to support the upper structure of the mannequin. The stand should be set into the base. To form the hips and shoulders of the mannequin, cut two oval pieces of plywood to form the hips and shoulders of the mannequin.</div><div class="column"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1049" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/21b-mannequin-RColl.jpg" alt="21b---mannequin---RColl" width="548" height="300"></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column">Glue the shoulder piece to the top end of a 270mm diameter PVC pipe. This pipe should slide easily over the timber forming the stand of the mannequin. Pass the tube to the bottom of the hip section. Glue in place using Araldite epoxy resin. Paint the stand with acrylic paint to seal the wood and the PVC.</div><div class="column"><div class="page" title="Page 24"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1050" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/21c-mannequin-RColl.jpg" alt="21c---mannequin---RColl" width="435" height="300"></div><div class="column">Create the body of the mannequin by wrapping galvanised chicken wire around the frame. This can be attached to the top of the shoulder piece and the bottom of the hip piece. Arms can be made separately from Dacron covered with fabric. They can be inserted into the sleeves or armholes of the costume first and then attached to the body using Velcro dots. If you do not want an arm shape to protrude from the costume, acid- free tissue can be used to pad out the sleeves.</div><div class="column">The waist is made by pulling a piece of string tightly around the cylinder of chicken wire. If you need to change the body shape of the mannequin, you can do so easily by bending the chicken wire.</div><div class="column"><div class="page" title="Page 24"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1051" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/21d-mannequin-RColl.jpg" alt="21d---mannequin---RColl" width="301" height="700"></div><div class="column">To pad the mannequin and protect your garments from the wire:</div></div></div></div><div class="column"><ul><li>cover the body of the mannequin with knitted cotton stockinet. Pull the tube of stockinet over the mannequin and attach it to the hip section. Then put Dacron in place to soften the surface of the wire and pad the mannequin to the appropriate shape; and</li><li>stitch the top of the stockinet in place.</li></ul></div></div><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column">If you wish, you can cover the mannequin with a fabric which will enhance the appearance of the costume. A collar can be made from a piece of fabric- covered cardboard. This will have to be made to fit each individual garment. You can use a simply constructed mannequin like this for a variety of costumes. The basic framework is there and the size and shape can be modified easily to suit several costumes of approximately the same size.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

They are designed for cleaning computers.</p><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>When vacuuming very fragile objects, it is useful to put a piece of Nylon net over the end of the hose. First attach a rigid pipe to the end of the hose. A piece of net 200mm square can be folded into quarters and attached over the pipe using a rubber band. This prevents fragile materials being sucked into the vacuum cleaner. The rigid pipe makes it easier to control where the hose is placed. The suction of the cleaner can be modified by using extra layers of more closely woven fabric.</p></div></div><figure id="attachment_970" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-970" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/Textiles_Cleaning-textiles.jpg" alt="Brush vacuuming a textile using a soft brush to sweep dust and debris into the vacuum, with netting over the nozzle to catch any loose fibres or fragments." width="500" height="362"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Brush vacuuming a textile using a soft brush to sweep dust and debris into the vacuum, with netting over the nozzle to catch any loose fibres or fragments.</figcaption></figure><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two methods of surface cleaning with vacuum suction.</p><div class="page" title="Page 25"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Hold the vacuum cleaner hose at least 20mm from the surface of the textile, and use a soft brush to lift the dirt from the surface of the textile.

									 <div class="page" title="Page 28"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>When preparing to mount or hang a textile for display, there are some important principles to remember:</p><p>The work you do should be reversible.</p><p>You should use only the minimum amount of stitching required to stabilise the textile.</p><p>Use the correct techniques and materials to ensure the long-term preservation of your textiles.</p><p>As a general rule, always use like with like. For example, a silk textile should be mounted on a silk fabric and stitched with silk thread. If you cannot use the same fibre, always use an inert synthetic fibre such as polyester. Using incompatible materials, such as using silk with cotton, accelerates the degradation of your textile.</p><p>Silk and wool are both protein fibres and are therefore compatible. Cotton, linen and other plant fibres are cellulose fibres and are compatible with each other.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Support fabrics</strong></span></p><p>A support fabric is the fabric on which a textile is mounted before framing. As a general rule, always use like with like; that is, a wool fabric should be mounted on wool.</p><p>This fabric is often exposed, either forming a border around the textile or showing through areas of damage in the textile. Therefore, it is important that the support fabric is similar in colour and weave to the original textile.</p><p>If you cannot buy a fabric of the correct colour, weave and fibre type, you can have fabric dyed by textile conservators experienced in colour matching or by commercial dyers.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Threads</strong></span></p><p>When selecting threads remember to always use like with like, for example, silk with silk or polyester, or cotton with cotton.</p></div><div class="column"><p>As a general rule, the finer the thread the better; but you will have to judge by the appearance of the fabric what denier of thread will be the most appropriate. For example, fine silk will require a fine silk or polyester thread. A woollen tapestry will require a coarser woollen thread.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stitches</strong></span></p><p>Before stitching your historic textiles, remember:</p><ul><li><p>to make sure that the needle passes in between the threads in the weave, not through them. If the needle passes through weakened fibres it can cause considerable damage;</p></li><li><p>to keep the tension of the stitches fairly loose, so as not to damage the fabric; and</p></li><li><p>do not use knots. Start your thread by leaving a tail at the back of your textile and stitch three small stitches in one position to anchor your thread.</p></li></ul><p>The next section describes the main stitches used in textile conservation.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Laid and couched stitching</strong></span></p><p>This is one of the main stitches used in conservation. It is used because it provides maximum support for the fabric with a minimal amount of stitching passing through the textile.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1052" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/22-stitch-RColl.jpg" alt="22---stitch---RColl" width="484" height="250"></p><div class="page" title="Page 28"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Couching is used to stitch worn areas of the textile to a support fabric underneath it.

It is used around the edge of a textile, and is also used when stitching a lining onto a textile in a grid pattern.</p><p>It is a good idea to do a back stitch approximately every 50mm: to lock the stitching in place so the textile does not slip along the stitching and so strain.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stab stitch</strong></span></p><p>Stab stitch is worked in the same way as running stitch, except the stitch on the surface of the textile is smaller than those underneath.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1054" src="./Textiles _ reCollections_files/22c-stitch-RColl.jpg" alt="22c---stitch---RColl" width="400" height="129"></p><div class="page" title="Page 29"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Herringbone stitch</strong></span></p><p>Herringbone stitch is generally used to stitch textiles with frayed edges.
