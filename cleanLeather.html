									 <div class="page" title="Page 33"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Leather is one of a range of manufactured materials which can be made from the skin of any animal.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Long before genuine tanning methods were used to prepare leather, hides and skins were processed in a variety of ways. The different processes were all designed to preserve the skins; and each process produced skin products with different properties. Working oil, grease and even brain matter into raw skins, softening hides by chewing them and smoking skins were some of the processes used. These methods affected both the look and feel of skins and their resistance to deterioration.</p><p>Technically, the term ‘leather' refers to skin products which have been fully tanned. Tanning is a process which chemically alters skins, making them more durable and more resistant to rotting. It does this by chemically linking relatively small molecules and fibres in the original skins into groups of larger molecules and fibres. Large molecules take longer to break down than smaller ones.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1094" src="./Leather _ reCollections_files/39-leather-rcoll.jpg" alt="39---leather---rcoll" width="428" height="400"></p><div class="page" title="Page 33"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Some of the other skin-processing methods also link fibres and result in larger molecules; but none of them do it as fully as the various tanning techniques, and none of them produce a material as durable as leather. Other skin products include rawhide, parchment and vellum, and semi-tanned leather.</p><p>Leather is made up of tanned collagen—the protein which makes up skin and bones—moisture, oils and fat.</p><p>Leather in good condition is naturally acidic: in the range of pH 3–6, with a water content of between 12–20% and a fat content in the range 2–10%.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>

									   <div class="page" title="Page 34"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Leather can be damaged in a number of ways.<br> It can be scuffed, worn, torn, scratched and abraded—for example, during cleaning—and over- lubricated—this reduces the moisture content of the leather and it will become hard, brittle and inflexible.</p><p>Leather is also adversely affected by inappropriate environmental conditions and by biological pests.</p><p>Light and UV radiation affect leather in a number of ways, including:</p><ul><li><p>providing energy to the chemical breakdown of the collagen that makes up the leather;</p></li><li><p>interaction with atmospheric pollutants, producing chemicals that damage leather and other materials associated with it;</p></li><li><p>fading of dyes; and</p></li><li><p>skin products with hair still attached often suffer hair loss through light-induced damage.</p></li></ul><p>Extremes of relative humidity are damaging to leather. In low relative humidity conditions, leather dries out and can become hard, brittle and cracked. When the relative humidity is over 65%, leather is susceptible to mould attack. Leather is even more attractive to mould if it has been lubricated too much, because mould uses the ingredients of the lubricants as a food source.</p><p>Vegetable-tanned leathers, including items of harness, military equipment and bookbindings and upholstery, are susceptible to deterioration known as red rot, caused by pollutants in the atmosphere.</p><p>Dust is a major problem for leather objects because it can cause both chemical and mechanical damage. The sharp edges of minute particles are abrasive, and can cause fibre damage if removed by methods other than suction. Dust also attracts fungal spores, and acts as a centre for condensation and subsequent chemical attack.</p><p>Moulds, bacteria, rats, termites and many other insects attack leather and the materials incorporated in it.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Leather is often combined with other materials: metal buckles, for example. The interaction of these materials can be damaging.</p><p>Many fatty materials incorporated in leather dressings, react with metal components of leather objects, causing them to corrode. Evidence of this corrosion is often seen, for example, the presence of a turquoise, waxy substance on copper fastenings. Metals may have been incorporated into the leather from materials used during the manufacturing process. Deterioration caused by the presence of metals in the leather is hastened when relative humidity is high.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about adverse environmental effect, please see <a href="./index.html">Damage and Decay</a>.</span></p></div></div></div></div>   								</div>

									      <div class="page" title="Page 35"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ideal conditions for storing leather</strong></span></p><p>Ideally, objects made from leather, hide and skin should be displayed and stored in a clean, well ventilated environment where temperature is constant and moderate—in the range 18–22°C. If this cannot be maintained, the maximum temperature should be 25°C.</p><p>Relative humidity should be kept in the range of 45–55%. In very dry conditions with the relative humidity below 30%, leather dries out and becomes brittle. High humidity, that is, above 65%, encourages mould growth.</p><p>Parchment and vellum are very sensitive to changes in relative humidity, and experience considerable dimensional change as they absorb and release moisture.</p><p>Leather must be protected from environmental fluctuations and dust and insect attack. Display cases and layers of storage provide this type of protection.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Lighting levels should be kept to a minimum, particularly for dyed leather. The brightness of light on undyed leather should be 150 lux or less; and on dyed leather it should be 50 lux or less.</p><p>A UV content below 30 μW/lm and no higher than 75 μW/lm is preferred for undyed and dyed leather.</p><p>Avoid exposing any leather to bright spotlights or direct sunlight, because these can cause leather to fade, discoloured and dry out.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General storage guidelines</strong></span></p><p>Good housekeeping is essential in the care of leather. Vacuum and dust regularly. This helps to minimise mould, insect and rodent attack.</p><p>Protect leather objects from dust using Tyvek dust covers, unbuffered acid-free boxes or acid-free tissue.</p><p>Check objects regularly to detect mould and insect infestations early.</p><p>Leather objects should be fully supported in storage and on display. They should be supported in their desired shape, so that if they harden later there will be no need for reshaping.</p><p>Store long leather pieces horizontally to make sure they are supported fully and evenly.</p><p>If three-dimensional objects are unable to support their own weight, then they should be supported internally. The form of the support depends on the shape of the object and the weight of leather to be supported. You can support and fill rounded items with unbuffered, acid-free tissue paper, or chemically stable polyethylene or polypropylene foams. You can make supports for other shapes using these foams.</p><p>Leather clothing and large objects such as saddles should be fitted on a dummy or a mount made-to- measure. Stable materials, such as the above- mentioned foams, linen, Dacron and most metals can be used in the manufacture of these supports.</p><p>Avoid sharp folds or creases in the leather. This helps reduce cracking.</p><p>Because leather products are naturally acidic, they should not come into contact with buffered, acid- free materials: these materials are alkaline and potentially damaging to leather.</p><div class="page" title="Page 36"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Storage cupboards and furniture should be made of painted metal—these provide a stable and neutral storage environment for leather objects.</p><p>If you have wooden storage and display furniture, it should be sealed and lined with impermeable coatings, for example, clear polyurethane or laminates. This reduces the risk of reactive chemicals from the wood affecting the leather objects or the metal components associated with the objects. Remember, sealants and glues should be fully dry and cured before putting objects into the storage environment.</p><p>Standard conservation-quality mounting and framing are usually adequate for the protection of art or documents on parchment.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>      								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									   <div class="page" title="Page 36"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Even cleaning has the potential to damage leather. For this reason, cleaning should not be considered as an automatic option for leather objects. Cleaning is recommended for:</p><ul><li><p>objects which need cleaning to prevent deterioration of the leather, which can be caused by surface deposits and/or mould growth; and</p></li><li><p>recently-acquired objects. Before their addition to the collection, they should be inspected and cleaned if necessary. This is essential to reduce the risk of contaminating the rest of the collection.</p></li></ul></div><div class="column"><p>Before cleaning leather objects, consider:</p><ul><li><p>the type and condition of the surface to be cleaned;</p></li><li><p>the nature of any contaminants or dirt;</p></li><li><p>the type of leather; and</p></li><li><p>exactly what is to be cleaned.</p></li></ul><p>Dirt or other accretions which have accumulated during an object’s useful life may be seen as historic evidence of the object’s use. You may not want to clean this evidence away.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What to clean</strong></span></p><p>Surface deposits which may need to be removed by cleaning include:</p><ul><li><p>dirt, dust and salts;</p></li><li><p>fatty spews and gummy spews—materials which migrate to the surface from the lubricants used on leather; and</p></li><li><p>mould.</p></li></ul><p>To identify crystalline salts, spews and mould you may need to examine the leather surface under magnification:</p><ul><li><p>the crystalline nature of salts would be clearly evident;</p></li><li><p>mould can be identified by the presence of fine, fibrous strands; and</p></li><li><p>fatty spews appear greasy, and can be difficult to remove; gummy spews look like resin deposits on the surface of the leather.</p></li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cleaning guidelines</strong></span></p><p>Before cleaning any leather objects, remember to assess the condition of the surface being cleaned. If the object is fragile, cleaning can cause further damage; and it might be better to protect the object from further soiling rather than cleaning it.</p><div class="page" title="Page 37"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It is important to remember that cleaning can stain leather, shift dyes as well as dirt within leather, and remove lubricants from leather. Always make sure that cleaning is necessary before starting.</p><p>If cleaning is necessary and the object is able to withstand it, there are a number of techniques you can use.</p><p>Vacuum cleaning, with the nozzle just above the leather surface and the power on the lowest setting, is probably the safest cleaning method. It is particularly suited to dusty leather which is in good condition. Place a gauze screen on the end of the nozzle when cleaning. This prevents fragments of leather being lost in the vacuum cleaner. If fragments are being lifted, reduce the suction of the vacuum cleaner.</p><p>Brushing with a soft, squirrel hair or camel hair brush is another way of removing surface dirt. Note that even using a soft-bristled brush can damage fragile objects—because dust is abrasive and can scratch a fragile surface. Also, small pieces of damaged leather may be dislodged.</p><p>Blowing dirt away with compressed air is appropriate for some objects. Take care that the air stream is not too strong, because it could damage fragile surfaces and dislodge leather fragments. Do this either outside or in a fume cupboard: to prevent dust being redeposited on the object.</p><p>Granular erasers can be used to remove more stubborn dirt. Use this method only on surfaces which are in good condition. Remember also that some erasers contain chemicals which can contribute to the deterioration of leather; so it is important that you select your eraser carefully. This is particularly important—it can be difficult to remove all traces of the eraser after cleaning.</p><p>To remove thick surface deposits such as those occasionally formed by fatty spews, scrape the surface using a soft, wooden spatula. This method should be used only to remove the bulk of the deposit; and care must be taken not to damage the leather surface. Solvents can be used to remove the remainder of the deposit left after scraping. This method is described below.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Residues or thin films of fatty or gummy spews can be removed using petroleum-based solvents such as white spirit or hexane.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Before using hexane and white spirit to clean the surface of the leather, test them on an inconspicuous area of the object to check that any surface finish on the leather is not affected by the solvent.</span></p><p>It is necessary to control the application of these solvents, because they can easily spread into the leather and dissolve fats in the body of the skin. The solvents can be applied with a small brush or cotton bud, or a sponge for larger areas. The solvents will soften the fats which you can then remove with a clean, cotton bud or your wooden spatula.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">White spirit and hexane should be used in a well ventilated area. Remember to protect your hands when using these solvents because they will dissolve the oils in your skin, as well as in the leather.</span></p><p>Use a slightly moistened sponge to remove water- soluble dirt from leather objects which are in good condition.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Use this treatment only where the surface of the object is protected by a water-resistant coating, for example, wax, resin or similar. Water can cause permanent darkening of leather and leave tidemarks in dyed leathers.</span></p><p>Alcohol or alcohol/water mixtures can be used to remove surface salts. Water can stain and damage leather, so keep the water content low. Test the mixture to make sure that it has no effect on the leather surface.</p><p>An emulsion cleaner is very effective for removing stubborn dirt. Because this formulation contains some water, test it in an inconspicuous area before applying it on a large scale.</p><div class="page" title="Page 38"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><div class="page" title="Page 38"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>CAUTION:</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Do not wet the surface of the leather itself during cleaning.

A sticky surface collects and holds dust, and is very hard to clean.</p><p>Lubricants do not provide protection against acidic pollutants.</p><p>Consider these points when deciding whether or not to apply a dressing to leather. If the leather is in its required shape, does not need to flex and is in a relatively stable environment, then lubrication is usually not necessary.</p><p>As leathers age, their ability to absorb fats and oils effectively is reduced. The amount of fats and oils needed in archaeological and older leathers is less than in their modern counterparts. Lubricating aged leather only causes more problems.</p><p>Dressings should not be used to ‘feed’ leather or as a way of improving its appearance. These approaches inevitably lead to over-lubrication and the development of some of the problems outlined above.</p><div class="page" title="Page 39"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>If you want to improve the appearance of a leather object which originally had a polished surface, it is better to use a wax polish.

They are usually stored and displayed. If the storage environment is stable, there is little need for lubrication.</p><p>To restore flexibility to hardened leather, it is necessary to rehumidify or condition the leather before lubrication. Various procedures may be used (Calnan, 1984). These include:</p><ul><li><p>sponging the surface with an alcohol solution diluted with water or a water-based moisturiser;</p></li><li><p>covering the leather with damp sawdust overnight; and</p></li><li><p>placing the leather in a humidity chamber.</p></li></ul><p>If an object needs to be reshaped then humidification often will be enough.</p><p>The next step in restoring flexibility to leather is the actual lubrication itself.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Types of lubricants for leather</strong></span></p><p>The fats and oils which lubricate the leather can be applied either in a water-based emulsion or dissolved in organic solvents. Fats and oils dissolved in an organic solvent are known as solutions or dressings.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Vegetable oils are not used as frequently as fats, because in the long term they are more prone to oxidation which results in the oil yellowing and hardening; this is followed by loss of the lubricating properties.</p><p>A water-based emulsion is best if tests show that:</p><ul><li><p>water does not discolour the surface; and</p></li><li><p>the surface absorbs water.</p></li></ul><p>Applying oils in emulsion increases the likelihood of oils remaining evenly distributed throughout the interior of the leather. If an emulsion cannot be applied, use a solvent-based dressing.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guidelines for the use of lubricants</strong></span></p><p>Only apply lubricants to leather which is:</p><ul><li><p>deformed—the lubricant is used to make the object more flexible and to assist in reshaping the object;</p></li><li><p>extremely dry; or</p></li><li><p>cracked due to shrinkage.</p></li></ul><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Never apply dressings to objects containing untanned or semi-tanned materials such as hides, parchment and vellum.</span></p><p>Always test the lubricant in an inconspicuous area before use.</p><p>When the leather is generally in good shape, but is dry and hard, applying a commercial dressing/wax such as Fredelka is useful.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">CAUTION:</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Fredelka should not be used on items with metal attachments or decorations because it causes corrosion of metal.</span></p><div class="page" title="Page 40"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>If the dryness is only a surface condition, or if the leather is very thin—for example, book covers and car seats—then a preparation such as British Museum Leather Dressing adequately restores surface-oil content.</p><p>Apply it sparingly, using a soft cloth. It can be used on leather with metal attachments or decorations. The beeswax in this dressing forms a thin film on the leather surface which can be polished.</p><p>Some surface finishes resist the penetration of oils and fats into the leather, whether you use an emulsion or a dressing. If this happens, it is best to rub an oil emulsion into the flesh side—or underside—of the leather, to encourage penetration.</p><p>Although many commercial leather dressings are available, these may not be suitable for museum objects because they are designed for leather objects which are being used.

Generally, leathers are either vegetable-tanned or mineral-tanned.</p><p>Vegetable tanning uses tannins which are present in the barks, woods, leaves and fruits of certain plants. The colour of the leather prior to finishing ranges from pale-brown to a reddish brown, depending on the particular tanning agents used. Vegetable-tanned leathers are particularly suitable for bookbinding.</p><p>Mineral processing uses mineral salts to chemically stabilise the skin. In the 1880s, chrome salts were used to make leathers which were hard-wearing, stable and water-resistant. The resilience and open texture of chrome-tanned leathers meant that they could not be embossed. These leathers were unsuitable for some kinds of work, particularly bookbinding.</p><p>During investigations into the improved durability of leathers, a number of experiments have been carried out using combined tanning techniques.</p><p>Another product which is thought of as a leather is alum-tawed leather. These white leathers were produced using a solution of alum and salt. Leather produced by this process is not a true leather, because it does not have the same chemical stability and resistance to water that fully tanned leather has. Zirconium salts are used to produce a white leather that is washable.</p></div></div></div></div>      								</div>

Cool the mixture to 20°C and add the surfactant. Mix thoroughly and rapidly. While stirring continuously, add the distilled water bit by bit. When all the water has been added, pour the mixture into a glass cylinder.</p><p>Observe the mixture for 10 minutes in the glass cylinder. If it remains stable and does not separate, it is ready for use. This mixture contains no preservatives and does not keep long. Refrigeration extends the life of the mixture.</p><p>Paint the cooled emulsion onto the leather using a soft-bristled brush. Allow the leather to dry between coats, if more than one coat is needed to achieve the desired flexibility.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lubricant solution</strong></span></p><ul><li><p>2g of lanolin</p></li><li><p>8g of neatsfoot oil</p></li><li><p>100ml of Shellsol T—aromatic-free white spirit.</p></li></ul><p>Dissolve the lanolin and neatsfoot oil in the Shellsol T. Paint the solution on the leather using a soft-bristled brush.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Some commercial neatsfoot oil products contain significant quantities of fatty impurities. These impurities will settle out on the surface of leather after dressing to form fatty spews. To remove these from your own neatsfoot oil, refrigerate it then discard the solid upper layer.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>British Museum leather dressing</strong></span></p><p>• 200g of lanolin<br> • 30ml of cedar oil<br> • 15g of beeswax<br> • 300ml of X-4 solvent or hexane</p><p>To prepare the dressing, the first three ingredients are mixed together and melted by careful heating. The molten mixture is then poured rapidly into the cold X-4 solvent and allowed to cool with stirring. The dressing should be applied sparingly and rubbed well into the leather with clean swabs. After two days the leather may be polished with a soft cloth.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">If you have a problem relating to the storage or display of leather objects, contact a conservator. Conservators can offer advice and practical solutions.</span></strong></p></div></div></div></div>     								</div>
