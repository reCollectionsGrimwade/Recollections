									    <div class="page" title="Page 51"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Although there are potential dangers in most activities associated with collections, we can become very blasé, especially when doing something we do often. The following notes are guides to good practice, and should also act as reminders that we must take care and act responsibly, even when under pressure.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Manual handling</strong></span></p><p>Lifting, carrying, moving, relocating, hanging exhibitions—people who work with collections are constantly involved in handling objects. In some cases these objects are heavy, in other cases simply awkward. The kinds of problems that can occur when undertaking these tasks are obvious. Nevertheless, they are common. Back problems, pulled and strained muscles, torn ligaments, bruises, cuts and similar injuries can all result from inappropriate handling techniques. Lifting loads that are too heavy is only one aspect of this story. Injury also occurs when the body is stressed—when it twists, bends or reaches in an inappropriate manner.</p><p>To ensure that you do not have these problems, check the following points.</p><p>Be prepared. When you move an object, know where it is going and have that area prepared. Also have the path between where you are and where you are going clear of obstructions.</p><p>Seek assistance. An object may not look heavy or awkward but, after you have held it for a short time, you may find it is increasingly difficult to hold. Awkward objects may not be heavy, but may cause you to twist or turn inappropriately. You are better off not moving an object than moving it without proper assistance. Not only can you hurt yourself, you may also damage the object.</p><p>Check the object. Is it secure and stable, or are there sections which may detach or loosen as you carry it? Can you grip it securely? Are there sharp edges? Is it top-heavy?</p><p>Plan before you start. If you are going to hang the object, make sure you have padding on the floor so that you can rest it and position yourself properly before lifting it. Check that the hanging system is appropriate and that you have a third person to help position the object, if necessary.</p><div class="page" title="Page 52"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Work out what else you need to assist you. Will you need gloves to protect either you or the object? Do you need to have padded surfaces ready? Will you need equipment, such as trolleys, to assist you? Do you need to make ramps so that you don’t have to lift an object?</p><div class="page" title="Page 52"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">For more information about handling objects, please see the chapter on <a href="">Handling</a> in <a href="">Handling, transportation, storage and display</a>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>    								</div>

								<div class="dslca-editable-content">
									       <div class="page" title="Page 52"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>There are a plethora of substances that can threaten health through inhalation. Such threats may be short or long term and can result in mild aggravation to, for example, the respiratory tracts or be life threatening.</p><p>Airborne substances include dust and particulates —organic and inorganic—vapours and gases.<br> A broad range of safety equipment is available for protection against these substances including dusk masks which cover mouth and nose for protection from particulates, respirators with filters for dust and specific groups of solvents and full face masks which may be fitted with their own air supply.</p><p>Before undertaking any activity which may cause or use potentially harmful substances including paints, varnishes, corrosion inhibitors and pesticides, seek appropriate technical advice from a qualified bureau or government agency.</p><div class="page" title="Page 52"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Protecting your hearing</strong></span></p><p>In working with a collection, you may use, or may be near people who are using, noisy machinery. Floor polishers, drills, saws, grinders are all examples of machinery that produce noise levels that can damage hearing. If a noise is loud enough to be irritating, it is worth protecting yourself by wearing ear plugs or ear muffs. Such protection should be provided for staff and volunteers as well.</p><p>Some equipment in conservation laboratories has no audible sound but can be potentially damaging to your hearing. Ultrasonic welders, for example, can be a problem. Ear muffs should be provided and the equipment should be well-maintained.</p><div class="page" title="Page 52"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Eye protection</strong></span></p><p>There are many ways in which eyesight can be damaged. Splintering glass, dust, sprays, solvents and mould spores can all enter the eyes and cause damage. In cases where there is likely to be material which could enter the eyes, safety glasses should be worn.</p><p>In some situations UV lights are used for examining objects. These lights can cause irreparable damage if not used properly or used without the appropriate eye protection.</p><div class="page" title="Page 53"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Protective gloves</strong></span></p><p>Some tasks require you to use solvents, pesticides or other chemicals. If you are handling any substance which you think may be harmful, wear protective gloves. There are many different types of gloves, from those that provide a physical barrier to those that provide complete solvent- protection. Chemical suppliers will be able to give you advice about the best types of protection.</p><div class="page" title="Page 53"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Protective footwear</strong></span></p><p>In some instances, problems can be caused by inappropriate footwear. Injuries can be caused by slipping, by dropping heavy or sharp objects, by corrosive chemicals or hot water, or by stepping on sharp objects.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Where possible, footwear should be solid, closed at the toe, and cover the whole foot; and if you are working with electrical tools, it should have non- conductive soles.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dangers associated with tools and machines</strong></span></p><p>In any operation using tools, it is possible to cause or sustain serious injury. Even seemingly harmless tasks such as mount cutting, drilling, screwing and hammering are potentially dangerous. To avoid injury and accident, make sure you know how to use the tools properly, and that anyone else who uses the tools also knows how to use them properly.</p><p>Don’t allow a person to undertake any task unless you are confident that they have the skill, experience and understanding to tackle it safely. Provide people with training where necessary.</p><p>Make sure tools are in good condition. If you have electrical tools, undertake regular safety checks of cords, plugs and switches. It is worthwhile considering having an earth leakage circuit breaker or other safety switches installed. A qualified electrician should be able to advise on your requirements.</p><p>Check your first aid knowledge, so that you feel confident to deal with an emergency. Refer to section on first aid training later in this chapter.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>       								</div>

Specialists at relevant state institutions will be able to provide initial advice.</p><div class="page" title="Page 56"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Also bear in mind that if you want to deaccession material that is a human-health threat, such as old X-ray equipment, you may be subject to health and safety laws relating to the disposal of such items.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hazards of office equipment</strong></span></p><p>Often cataloguing and condition reporting require the use of computer and photocopy equipment. Prolonged use of such equipment can have serious health ramifications. For example, photocopiers produce ozone; and inappropriately set-up computer workstations can lead to muscle, back and eye strain.</p><p>Many publications relate to the safe use of such equipment, for example, Australian Standard 3590- 1990 <em>Screen-based Workstations</em> Part 1-13. The relevant State and Territory occupational health and safety departments will be able to provide advice.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>  								</div>
