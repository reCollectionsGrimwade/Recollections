Every object in your collection should in some way contribute to the aims of your museum, gallery or library. Just as much thought should be given to refusing material as to obtaining it.

									 <div class="page" title="Page 32"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It is a fundamental fact of life that some things are more important than others. We are confronted by this continually. If you’re going on holiday, what items will you pack? What will you leave behind? Why are some issues given greater prominence in the news?</p><p>Most people would also be aware that something which is significant to one group of people may have little or no meaning at all to others. For example, religious icons sacred to some cultural groups are largely irrelevant to others. Similarly, an object may have no significance to one museum yet be quite significant to another. A mouldboard plough, for example, is of no interest to a doll museum, but might be highly relevant to a museum of farm machinery.</p></div><div class="column"><p>Uniqueness plays a part in significance. If an object is duplicated in a museum collection, its significance is often diminished.</p><p>The significance of an item will vary depending on what it is and what collection it is in. And its significance will, in turn, have a bearing on how it is managed and its future treatment in the collection.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is significance?</strong></span></p><p>Significance will be defined differently by each museum, gallery and library; and considerable work has been done by organisations which have already arrived at their own definitions of significance.</p><p>It is helpful to look at some of the broad categories already developed by others, in order to get a clearer picture of the values you may wish to include in a definition of significance.</p><p>The Australian National Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (Australia ICOMOS) adopted a charter, known as the Burra Charter, in 1979, which provides ethical and practical guidelines for the selection of built heritage sites for conservation and for the conservation treatment of those sites. The charter is based on principles that are accepted world- wide. In 1984 the committee adopted guidelines to assist in determining cultural significance:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Cultural significance is a concept which helps in estimating the value of places. The places that are likely to be of significance are those which help an understanding of the past or enrich the present, and which will be of value to future generations.</em></p><p>In the Burra Charter, assessing cultural significance means determining the aesthetic, historic, scientific and/or social value of a place.</p><p>Definitions of significance can be very broad or quite narrow. The Burra Charter is designed to cover sites and monuments over the whole country and therefore has to be broad enough to encompass a range of local differences.</p><p>Most museums and galleries will be concerned with collecting only in relation to their own locality or their special area of interest. Their definitions of significance should reflect this.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page" title="Page 33"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>It should be noted also that although the definitions of significance in the Burra Charter are designed to cover sites and monuments, they can be applied easily to other types of objects, and have been.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Significance and collection management</strong></span></p><p>The assessment of the significance of objects has an important function in both the decision to acquire an object and in collection management. Knowing the significance of an item can help museums, galleries and libraries determine such matters as:</p><ul><li><p>whether they should acquire an item;</p></li><li><p>whether an item should have conservation treatment and whether there is a high priority for this treatment;</p></li><li><p>how it will be conserved—what information and attached wrappings, labels and dirt, must be preserved along with the item;</p></li><li><p>whether the item will go on immediate display and whether there are any protocols to be observed in the way the item is displayed;</p></li><li><p>whether the item should be displayed in a particular way to give heightened emphasis to particular features; and</p></li><li><p>how much interpretive material is required.</p></li></ul><p>Many specialist and local museums face the problem of large backlogs of items which have yet to be registered. Assessing the significance of each object in turn will help the museum decide whether it should be accessioned or become Special Purpose Material. This process should also determine whether or not the object should even be accepted into the collection.</p><p>The assessment of significance is not always easy; and it is even more difficult to make judgments about the relative significance of objects. Taking three objects at random from a typical local museum, how would you rank the relative significance of a police baton, a corn dolly and a fob watch? The answer may depend not merely on the objects themselves, but on their provenance or accompanying documentation, which provides supporting information about their manufacture and history of use. For a great many museum objects, significance is greatly enhanced if information exists on their history of ownership and use. Such information may lead you to research the item further, in order to establish its significance relative to other items in the collection.</p></div><div class="column"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Assessment of the significance of acquisitions</strong></span></p><p>As stated earlier, most museums and galleries will be concerned with collecting only in relation to their own locality or their special area of interest. It is worthwhile to clearly define that locality or special interest in order to:</p><ul><li>develop curatorial guidelines to assist in decisions about allocation of resources;</li><li>develop an acquisition policy; and</li><li>make it clear to other organisations what your interests are. This can lead to greater cooperation between organisations, and reduces the chance of clashes with other museums or galleries in the region. By networking you can be more aware of what other institutions are doing.</li></ul><p>When determining whether or not to acquire an object, test each object against a list of curatorial criteria. Lists of criteria are often contained in the collections policy. There is no set number of criteria which each object should fulfil. It may be that only one of the criteria is met but, if the supporting evidence is strong enough, this might be sufficient to justify acquisition of the object.</p><p>Below is an extract from the History Trust of South Australia’s acquisition policy document, which sets out its criteria for historical significance. These criteria are quite detailed and reflect this organisation’s position as a large collecting institution. Smaller organisations may have less complex criteria.</p><p>Other factors in determining whether or not to acquire an object could include:</p><ul><li>its future display purpose;</li><li>whether it is original or has been substantially restored;</li><li>whether it will increase our understanding and knowledge of some aspect of our history if placed in association with other related objects, for example, if it were one of a group of devotional objects; and</li><li>the size of the object.</li></ul><p>Historical Significance</p><div class="page" title="Page 34"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Discussion</p><p>An object, site, activity, idea or the like is considered historically significant if it is important to the history of South Australia.</p><p>The History Trust of South Australia describes the historical significance of an object according to the criteria set out below.</p><p>The practice varies between the History Trust’s divisions. The National Motor Museum, for example, has a national rather than a South Australian focus.</p><p>The following criteria are always applied within the context of the History Trust and divisional aims and objectives as well as acquisition policies.</p><p>Criteria</p><p>a) &nbsp;Objects which were designed locally</p><p>b) &nbsp;Objects which were manufactured locally</p><p>c) &nbsp;Objects which were used locally</p><p>d) &nbsp;Objects which demonstrate important social or technological changes</p><p>e) &nbsp;Objects reflecting creative communal or technical accomplishment</p><p>f) &nbsp;Objects which are valued by sections of the South Australian community for social, economic, cultural, religious or spiritual reasons</p><p>g) &nbsp;Objects which demonstrate important social customs</p><p>h) &nbsp;Objects associated with important themes in the State’s history, such as early non-Aboriginal settlement, political and social change and the impact of war</p><p>i) &nbsp;Objects which are the first or last of a series</p><p>j) &nbsp;Objects which are rare examples of once commonly available types (note: the History Trust distinguishes sharply between rare survivals of the once common and the rare survival of the always rare. The National Motor Museum rejects vehicles fitting into the latter category)</p><p>k) &nbsp;Five additional criteria are applied where objects meet any of the above criteria:</p><p>i) &nbsp;extent of accompanying documentation</p><p>ii) &nbsp;condition of the object</p><p>iii) &nbsp;cost of preserving and storing the object</p><p>iv) &nbsp;relationship to other objects which reinforce its significance</p><p>v) &nbsp;availability in collections elsewhere.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> 								</div>

									  <div class="page" title="Page 35"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>How do you decide what is significant for your collection?</p><p>Consider this. Imagine you are the curator of the Mythical Museum in a small coastal country town settled by Europeans in 1845. Mythical was originally a base for sealing and whaling and was once a busy shipping port with a railway line connecting it to the interior, a busy centre for agricultural exports. It is now a busy service community whose economic future will be strongly linked to tourism as well as to agriculture and other service industries.</p><p>Would you accept or reject the following items which have been offered to your museum? This example was adapted from a book by Ellis Burcaw (1975).</p><ol><li><p>The wedding suit of the town’s first mayor;</p></li><li><p>a well-catalogued collection of North American birds’ eggs;</p></li><li><p>a stone reputedly brought back from the shores of Gallipoli by a veteran of<br> World War I;</p></li><li><p>a header harvester in poor condition;</p></li><li><p>the uniform of a local Aboriginal soldier who served in World War I;</p></li><li><p>a small collection of carnival glass—there is no accompanying documentation;</p></li><li><p>the piano owned by a woman who taught music to children from the district for 30 years;</p></li><li><p>a BSA motor bike, restored by an enthusiast who brought it with him to the district two years ago;</p></li><li><p>a quilt made by the local branch of the Country Women’s Association to commemorate the town’s 150th anniversary;</p></li><li><p>a meteorite collected from another State by a local identity 30 years ago.</p></li></ol><p>Some suggested answers in numerical order are:</p><ol><li>yes</li><li>no</li><li>no</li><li>no</li><li>yes</li><li>possibly for exchange</li><li>yes</li><li>possibly for exchange</li><li>yes</li><li>It would depend on how important the local identity had been in the town’s history, and what other objects relating to him are held by the museum.</li></ol></div><div class="column"><p>There are no right answers for any of these. Each object should be examined individually. What is important to one group of people, say with an interest in Mythical’s civic history, may be considered insignificant and of no interest by another group with a passionate interest in sealing and whaling.</p><p>Some items could be worthwhile keeping as Special Purpose Material, which could be held for possible future exchange or for educational purposes. If acquiring an object is completely out of the question, it may be possible to refer the would-be donor to a more suitable museum or collecting institution.</p></div></div></div></div>  								</div>

									  <div class="page" title="Page 37"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Objects which have been identified as significant within a collection should be given priority in terms of their conservation. At its simplest, this means ensuring that they are given preference when it comes to providing secure covered storage or display space. If a conservation survey shows that a number of objects require treatment, again, the most significant items should have priority.</p><p>Keep in mind that an object which was made locally but which may not have been widely used outside your district may be more significant to your museum than a similar object which enjoyed wider use. For example, there may have been a blacksmith or implement maker who built a successful local business but could not compete later with larger manufacturers. One of his ploughs could still be more important to your museum than another type used locally but manufactured elsewhere. If so, its conservation should have greater priority.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have a problem relating to the acquisition and significance of objects, contact a conservator. Conservators can offer advice and practical solutions.</span></p></div></div></div>  								</div>

Museums should be aware of the significance of objects before they acquire them. Particularly important objects should be given priority for conservation work; some may have restrictions on how they can be viewed, while others may need to have particular features emphasised, or require a great deal of interpretation so that their significance can be understood.</p></div><div class="column"><p><strong>Question 3.</strong></p><p>Answer:</p><p>a) &nbsp;No</p><p>b) &nbsp;Yes, provided suitable storage can be found</p><p>c) &nbsp;No</p><p>d) &nbsp;No</p><p>e) &nbsp;Yes</p><p><strong>Question 4.</strong></p><p>Answer: b), d) and e). The decision to accept or reject should be made by the organisation, not by an individual within it.

If it was in common use it represents an important aspect of local history, whereas if it was always rare it has little historical meaning. Even if it was made elsewhere, its history of use in the district is important. Objects of antique value may have no local significance whatever, and museum collections will soon become cluttered and inaccessible if they take the easy option and accept everything.</p></div></div></div></div>								</div>
